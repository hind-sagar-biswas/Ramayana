Rama as hero of this epic identifies his heroine Seetha's face with the tranquil sheet of lake's water, her eyes with the lotuses, and her quick glances with the quick swims of the fishes in the lake. Rama as god incarnate observes the tranquil sheet of water as the quiescence of his creation. The red lotuses are meditatively standing, as the devotees ready to be taken away to the feet of their god. The swimming fishes are seen as the souls captivated in human bodies, rushing hither and thither for salvation, which is hindered by the banks of life [here the banks of the lake.] Thus on certain occasions we chance to meet with the different points of view of Rama, one as hero and the other as god incarnate, derived from the metaphors or similes by the ancient commentators.\n"

            "comment": "Prof. R. D. Ranade, the eminent professor of Indian Philosophies said that \"Translations are always bound to be uncouth; they are like a heavy cart-load which moves slowly along...\" So also Ramayana, whose text itself is a cartload, and the translations become many more cartloads. Much can be said in Kishkindha Kanda, for it comprises of many a derivative, which cannot be compressed and put together. The hero-heroine and the god incarnate aspects, together with some Indian philosophies included, are sufficient to become some more cartloads. The Hindu Love-god, Manmadha, unlike his European counterpart Cupid, has no body. At one time, Shiva burned Him down physically, for arousing lasciviousness in Shiva Himself. But Shiva makes the Love-god Manmadha to thrive without a physical body, at the request of Love God's wife Rati. Hence Love God is also called an anga = without, body. The bodiless nature and only the emotive responses in love are symbolical with the formless activity of romancing aroused by ananga or Manmadha, i.e., Love God. Alternately the word Manmadha not necessarily be taken as a noun, denoting the Love God alone. As a phrasal verb it denotes, mind, churning. mann; manas; madhaH - mannamsi mathate iti manmathaH... to churn. There is a platform called manas , below the subconscious level, and above sensory organs, which receives all the input from the sensory organs, which the manas separates, categorises, analyses and so on, and then sends to databank at subconscious level. Amara Kosha defines it as cittantu ceto hR^idayam svaantam hR^in maanasam manaH || dhii vargaand the separation is chittam, chetaH, hridayam, svaantam, hrit, maanasam, manH and this is not the composite mind, but a faculty of reason, what we generally call, a heart, a mind, a thought etc. Hence the lamentation of Rama is more churned out of his manas for Seetha, not just for amorousness, but for real love. And love, as per good old saying, is togetherness. Having lost that togetherness, Rama is pouring out his heart churned agony. Yet again, Rama the god indulges in those that are indulged in Him, and here his thoughts are constantly indulged in Seetha, his alter ego in heavens and on earth. In the Vaishnava mythologies, Vishnu incarnating on earth always looses his consort, Goddess Lakshmi and roams over to find Her. It is the same situation in narasimha incarnation. Goddess Lakshmi is a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, after which Her consort Vishnu searches and retrieves Her, for no one on earth can amass heavenly wealth. In Lakshmi tantra, the Vaishnava aagama text Lakshmi states that: aham naaraayanii naama saa sattaa vaiShNavii paraa \" I am indeed Naaraayanee [i.e. Lakshmi] the supreme essence of Vishnu...\" [Lakshmi Tantra 3.1.] Hence, Seetha may not be taken as yet another princess from this viewpoint.\n"

[4-1-29b, 30a]\n",
            "comment": "Vasanta or spring is a friendly season, and Kishkindha is a friendly place, [and Rama gets more friends in this place later,] but Rama's lifetime friend and supreme essence is missing. For god, this burning is the sensation or perception of energy as warmth shown by the devout nature, and its blessed souls. Shaiva/Shaakta traditions emphasises the power and majesty of the God, whereas the Vaishnava theory demands a heart pouring devotion to achieve the God's saving grace anugraha . Hence the lamentation of Rama as god is for the departure of his Shakti, i.e., Goddess Lakshmi, visualising all the nature and its component devotees he created, such as, trees, peacocks, birds, flowers, waters, mountains etc. All of this nature and its components are maddening Him for love from that Shakti.\nThis point of view requires some understanding of Vaishnava canons and some paancharaatra aagama expositions. The readers may find them in a great essay of Prof. Samjukta Gupta on Pancharatra, in a 'worm's eye view', [for she calls it that way,] in a book called Mantra . It is a collection of essays on the Hindu hymns by eminent Indologists like Frits Staal, Ellison Banks Findly et al, published by the State University of New York Press, State University Plaza, Albany, N.Y., 12246. These are published under their SUNY Series in Religious Studies, and this one is under the editorship of Harvey P. Alper.\nFor the hero in the epic, it is the want of warmth from the heroine. It may please be noted that if Rama addresses Lakshmana in the verse, it is a dialogue. Otherwise it is to be treated as monologue or soliloquy or aside or the character's heartfelt feelings, aimed for communicating to us, but not to Lakshmana alone. Not all the verses are spoken to Lakshmana. It is a kind of commixture of dramatics and narration. Here the lovelorn Rama views Ashoka trees as the arrow of the Love god, manmadha. The Love God has five arrows and they are:\n1.aravinda= a lotus [nelumblum speciosum], 2. ashoka= a flower of hellebore origin, 3. chutam= mango flower, 4.nava mallika= new jasmine, 5.neela utpala= blue costus, are the five arrows of Manmadha.\n(1) Aravindam flower-arrow  hits chest (2) Asoka flower-arrow lips (3) mango flower-arrow head (4) new jasmine flower-arrow eyes; (5) blue costuses hits anywhere.\nTheir functions are: -\nThe five states associated with each arrow are: -1.unmaada= maniacal state, tapana= fervent state, 3. shoshaNa= wasting away, 4. sthambhana= standstillness, 5. sammohana= stupifaction.\nThe Ashoka flower kills natual hunger, Jasmine desciccates, mango flower fades the colour, and lotusess causes criss-cross thinking, and the costuses incite the desire for suicide.\n",

Rama instead of blessing the crow to look like a white-swan blessed it to be proficient in foretelling. The crow's cawing is for both good and bad omens, which even now is an accepted belief. If the crow roves over in the sky continuously cawing, it is bad omen. If it sits on nearby tree or wall and caws incessantly, it is good omen to get desired things or to indicate the arrival of dear ones etc. Such prognostications are available by way of bad dreams etc., at many places in Ramayana.\n"

Seetha also holds the lotus dear and every aspect of Seetha is lotus oriented and thus Rama's remembering of Seetha by seeing lotuses. [Ibid. satatam priya pankajaam - 4-1-67.]\n2] Goddess Lakshmi sits in the middle of the lotus, which will be in the heart of Vishnu. As of now She is stolen and Rama could not avert it. Hence the lotuses are angered at the loss of their resident Goddess Lakshmi, are taking the help of the breeze to carry the scent of the pollen, which is akin to Seetha's breath, and invade Rama's heart, to regain their tenant. Then a question arises as to why Rama confronts the invasion of this spring breeze without going away from there. In reply it is said that this breeze is like Seetha's breath, and it is coming from out of the thickets of the forests. So she must be around and appear to him any moment. Regaining Seetha is prime ordeal than the invasion of the cool spring breeze.\n3] Another way of putting this is: -- padma = Goddess Lakshmi; kesara - or - kesaraiH = affection, like fragrant pollen; samshR^iSTaH = carrying; vR^iksha antara vi nisshruta = tree of the Universe, within it, emitted; nishvaasa iva = uninterrupted breathe, like; siithaayaa = of Nature [Seetha the feminine, is symbolised with the whole creative Universe,] vaayuH = all-pervading ether [mythical]; manaH = [sins of] heart; haraH = stealing/obliterating one.\nThis is based on the ashwattha structure of the Universe.\nThe roots of Aswattha tree [the Holy fig tree, Ficus Religiosa, meaning that: shva = tomorrow; na stha = not there; the tree of the Universe that will not be there tomorrow, i.e., this Universe perishes, are inthe firmament and its stem, branches, and leaves spread upside down as this Universe. This is similar to the Igdrasil of Scandinavian mythology. Goddess Lakshmi sitting in Her Divine Lotus in empyrean abode exhales Her uninterrupted affection as the all-pervading ether, within the tree i.e., Universe, which is the life principle. When the created being is endowed with Her affection, but becomes a sinner, She recommends even that sinner to the Almighty Vishnu for obliteration of his sins and to accord salvation. Hence Vaishnavites demand heart-pouring devotion to the Almighty, than indulging in earthly cherishing. This is termed as nirhetuka satata dyaa prasaara i.e., without any precondition the grace of Goddess Lakshmi always flows.\n",

Hence He felled His body to become two… and from thereon humans originated…Brihadaaranyaka Upanishat 1-4-3.\nThe lustful words of Rama are to be construed as pure pleasure forhaving Seetha at his side, as a longing to have His first creation with himself. This is for deifying Rama as incarnation of Vishnu. All the Ramayana-s or Purana-s which deal with the episode of Rama's reaction on seeing Pampa Lake have the same import. In Skanda Purana there is yet another instance stating that Rama gave curses to such lusty components of nature, for his lust is not satiated. It is as below: -\n\"Champaka flowers [Hindi: Mogra; Telugu : Sampega; Botanical : Michelia champaka] are not to be touched by Honeybees, chakravaaka, [water-birds, ruddy geese, know for their inseparable swimming] be separated in midnight, Kokila birds [Blackcuckoos] be grownup in other's nests [i.e., in crow's nest] Sandalwood trees become shelters to snakes, the breeze [that is cool and incited Rama's thoughts about Seetha,]shall become food of snakes… thus cursed Rama, in his anguish about his separation from Seetha…\" Skanda Purana.\n",

            "comment": "Here in the verse plural number is used for hands, aayataaH, baahavaH, parighaaH, whereas so far, dual number, dvivachana is used to describe any two. The ancient commentators take this as many hands, more than two, as opposite to other dual numbered wording. For this it is said that since Lakshmana is a right hand to Rama, Hanuma sees a three-handed god in Rama. But Hanuma is talking to both Rama and Lakshmana; there shall be two deities with two hands each. The accepted phenomenon is that, Hanuma as a true devotee has seen the fourhanded Vishnu in Rama. This is according to Govindaraja. Next, the arms of Rama are of protective nature to the friendly ones. aayaataaH, lengthily ones - they can be stretched to any extent, and on the other hand, anything can depend on them, as in yopaam aayatanam veda... and this su vrittaaH, round like the serpent's hoods, or body builder's clubs, is to tell that no one can near them. Thus, the spherical universe can depend on the spherical shoulders of Rama. Thus Hanuma is reminding Rama of his wild-boar incarnation where the whole world is lifted on his snout from waters. The word parighaH, is to say that those spherical shoulders can remove difficulties of those who adore them. The parighaH in simple terms means, clubs, bludgeon, or ancient dumbbell unlike the present day dumbbells of gym, but the word is deciphered to be pari gha fully, removing, or fully, falling to one's lot. That is, here these shoulders are mighty to eliminate Vali and these hands if shook by Sugreeva in friendship, Sugreeva's miseries will be removed completely.\n"

Their apparels and hair tufts are like those of sages and hermits, along with their self-contradictory resemblance as would-have-been emperors, and their mighty weaponry, and every other thing he said are the quotes from lakshana shaatra, the scripture that prescribes the qualities of great emperors. This is what the other two listeners are assessing about the questioner also. In the midst of this unpopulated thick forest, some ascetic comes in, talks at length, that too without offence to the scriptures, is the doubt of those two brothers. This particular questioner is not definitely any ascetic or sage, because he is roaming in deep forests, rather than around some villages where he may get some charities. And also that, generally ascetics will talk, only when they are talked to, but this one with some purpose behind, is almost pestering to reveal the identity of the intruders. Hence the brothers took Hanuma to be another demon or anyone sent by somebody, for they already knew about the Vali-Sugreeva episode. Apart from this, Rama is following his own Imperial protocol of assessing the person approaching on his own, who is talking like this one, and who has high knowledge of all the scriptures. This analysis, Rama gives to Lakshmana after a few more verses. For now, Hanuma had to yield to high resistance from those two brothers, and is going to reveal himself, with a come-what-may attitude.\n"

In Yajurveda many anuvaaka-s or passages occur recursively, with different utilisation. Remembering not to mix one with the other is a difficult process. Hence the recitalist has to have enormous remembrance. In Saamaveda the pitch and duration of the rendering is of high importance, as such it requires a scholarly bent to control vocal notes. The three words, vinaya, schooling; dhaaraNa, remembrance and vedana knowledge are required to each of the above Veda-s. Atharva Veda, on the other hand, has no recital performance other than the above. Hence, it is said, is not quoted by Rama. Hanuma said 'you two are eligible to rule the earth' as at 4-3-15, which tantamount to the quote brhamaa vaa idam ekaeva agra aasiit... from Rigveda aitereya. Next he said that you are deities inhuman form at 4-3-13, which has its bearing on the Yajurveda quote ajaayamaano bahudhaa vijaayate...

            "comment": "For the above three stanzas very lengthy commentary is rendered of which some points are detailed here. Lady Tara is elucidating the whole being of Rama as gathered by her from her son Angada. The second foot of verse 19 starts with the words nivaasa vR^iksha a habitable tree; if it be asked why Rama is compared with a tree, then it is said that tree requires no formalities like 'may I come in...' or 'rights of admission reserved...' etc., as with any other house or habitation, for taking hold of its shade. A tree first gives its shade to the traveller who seeks it and then affords its fruits or flowers satisfying the basic needs of the needy. So Rama is such a tree that protects and nourishes, should anybody seek his grace.\nNext is saadhuunaam for polite supplicants he is the ultimate course. Tara is saying indirectly that Vali is not at all polite in treating Sugreeva either as crown prince of Kishkindha or as his own younger brother. As such Vali cannot supplicate to Rama at this stage for his impoliteness to Sugreeva and to Ruma, wife of Sugreeva, which is intolerable to Rama, and hence Vali shall not confront Rama. aartaanaam for earnest and anguished supplicants Rama is the ultimate recourse. This is what later said in Bhagavat Gita at 9-22, yoga skhemam vahamyaham... Vali may dismiss this idea saying that 'if Rama is the ultimate course for the polite supplicants, I have my recourse to other supreme lords, i.e., none other than Indra, my father...' And for this Tara is supplementing her thought in saying, yashasaH ca eka bhaajanaH the grace Rama is the only ultimate abode, where Indra and others are but penultimate. Hence as long as Rama is standing guard to Sugreeva, Sugreeva cannot be trivialised and this again as said in Bhagavad Gita, na me bhaktaH praNashyati... at 9-31.\nAlternately, it is again as said later in Gita at 7-16 that chaturvidhaa bhajante maam... 'four kinds of devotees worship me...' Those four are, one who is seeking knowledge saadhuunaam; those that are interested in salvation, kaivalya kaamuka; like King Priikshit. One seeking of material gains aapannaanaam; those that seek the material gains that were not there previously to them, also called artha ardhii; like Sugreeva, Dhruva. One who is distraught aartaanaam; those that are in anguish like Gajendra, the Elephant caught in lake by crocodile in gajendra moksha. And the fourthly one who is a wise person yashasaH j~naani; gloriously enlightened one, like Shuka, Sanaka, Naarada, Bhiishma, Prahlada. And this wise one is impossible to exist and if he is there 'he is my soul j~naanii tu aatmaiva me matam...' Gita 7-18.For all these four kinds Rama is ...eka bhaajanam..., the only recourse.\nNext is j~naana, vij~naana sampatti In that j~naana is privy to the materialistic, worldly, kingly affairs. vij~naana is the knowledge derived from the scriptures, providentially profound. Or, through karmadhaaraya, j~naanaH ca asau vij~naa sampannaH ca... corporeally he is the knowledge, and spiritually he is gnostic as well. Hence he is the phenomenon of the Supreme Being in maintaining dharma. In order to maintain that dharma Rama is now observant of his father's orders pituH nideshe nirataH. This pursuit of father's orders is but one of the many other attributes of his dharma, and that alone is said here as secondary attribute, upa lakshaNa. Hence in pursuing his dharma Rama may eradicate adharma of Vali, insofar as Vali's misdemeanours towards Sugreeva and his wife Ruma are concerned. guNaanaam aakaraH; with his auspicious merits he is a Great Mine. Usually these guNa-s, attributs of Vishnu are six as per Vaishnavaite classification, con solidating them as ShaDguNa sampatti , which are aishvarya, viirya, yashas, shrii, j~naana, vairaagya. And there are many more in the depth of the soul of Rama hitherto unexcavated. As such, there are innumerable and auspicious elements, or merits, in him dhaatuunaam shailendraH. These elements neither subdivide nor shake him off his Himalayan personality, in the pursuit to establish dharma.\n"

Bringing Maithili from the captivity of Ravana would have averted Vali's death - so Vali thought. But who will bring Ruma, wife of Sugreeva, and give her back to Sugreeva? Vali does not consider this, and in this alone Vali's transgression is said to have been proved. Thus any truce between Vali and Rama is an impossible and improbable proposition.\nWhat all Rama wanted is the 'search for Seetha...' not bring her to his fore. Elimination of Ravana is to be done by Rama alone, for which Seetha is to be located first. If a truce is struck between Vali and Rama, Vali straightway goes to Ravana and asks for Seetha. If Ravana yields Seetha there is no cause left for his elimination. Ravana for sure refuses to yield her. Then a combat ensues between Ravana and Vali. But Vali can combat one-to-one in a duel and he may not encounter a magical war of Indrajit or Kumbhakarna. Then all the demons will combine to eliminate Vali, thus the epic concludes there haphazardly. Other way round, if Vali seeks help of Ravana and his military to combat Rama, Vali's forces and Ravana's forces will come down on a handful warriors like Rama, Sugreeva Hanuma, and Jambavanta et al. Then the whole of monkey force will be with Vali, and these few warriors will be routed down mercilessly. Above all, Rama has promised Sugreeva to eliminate Vali, the abuser of tradition, and Rama becomes blameworthy if he fails in his word. Hence the simplest formula 'enemy's friend is my enemy too...' works well and Rama followed that only.\n"

If Rama comes to fore, fear may grip Vali, then he may take Ruma, Sugreeva's wife, and to insult, Sugreeva further, Vali may go to a distant place with her. Or, he may seek shelter with Ravana. Or, he may even take refuge in Rama like Sugreeva. Or, on seeing Sugreeva with enough support, he may summon all his Vanara army to fight with Sugreeva and his supporters. Then it will prolong for a time. Then the promise of Rama made to Sugreeva to accord his wife and his kingdom by killing Vali, also prolongs. Justice delayed is denied. Otherwise, if Vali surrenders to Rama, as the killing of a refugee is not a merited act, Rama has to pardon Vali. Whether Vali takes refuse or not, killing Vali on that day itself, and establishing Sugreeva in Kishkindha are the promises made by Rama, at the time of befriending Sugreeva. The word given is to be kept up. So Rama did it and there is no unrighteous deed done by Rama. And Vali also accepts this in the coming stanzas.\n"

His argument with Tara at the start of 16th chapter details this. He asks Tara, 'If Rama is a virtue-knower and a diligent one, how then he can sin, in killing me?' Vali, unlike Ravana, never goes to a duel unless provoked. Vali being a wilful combatant and Sugreeva is coming for a second time with the support of Rama, he wanted to defeat that unknown Rama, along with suppressing Sugreeva's trivial pride. Vali promises Tara that he is not going to kill Sugreeva, but wanted to take him to task. On coming to field Rama is not evident. Then Vali wanted to see to Sugreeva first and then search for Rama.

In Patiala's Motibagh Bir Zoo there is penitentiary for primates where all bad monkeys are jailed without parole, and there will be a signboard, asking visitor to not to go nearby the enclosure, because it will be dangerous. Each of its inmates is caught, even across Punjab and other places, when that monkey is destroying property, thieving and attacking people and creating havoc. Hence monkey menace is something different from monkey havoc. Throughout India we have monkey menace, which is very frequently beamed by Discovery and National Geography channels, but it is rarely said about bad monkeys. Killing a monkey, however bad it is, is a taboo and sustaining its havoc is an altogether unbearable affair. Now that the bad monkey of Ramayana is eliminated, search for Seetha is possible.\n",

Thus you have conquered all such physicality.'\n'I thought you to be an unrighteous person in killing my husband, but you are uttama dhaarmikaH supreme among the righteous souls, because you have helped Sugreeva without any personal greed...' A person who undertakes and does a deed only for himself is a base-level righteous person. One, who does so for his benefit, and for the benefit of a few others, is a middle-level righteous one. And a highest level righteous one undertakes anything to protect righteousness alone. In killing Vali, Rama has got only one point in view, 'to eliminate an abuser of tradition, caaritra duuSaka... and not even bothering for the searchers of Seetha. When Rama can eliminate fourteen thousand demons of Khara in Aranya Kanda and also when he can put the sea to turmoil, can he not fling his arrow to the other side of that ocean to kill Ravana? He can, but he has to course through Sugreeva's friendship to punish Vali, among other things. 'So you are supreme among these kinds of benefactors, because you have paved way to Vali to go to heavens instead of netherworlds... so no discredit ensues...'\nRama may question as to 'why you are eulogising me when I got discredit in killing Vali without confronting him?' For this she said a + kshayya kiirti 'unmitigated is your glory...' 'you are renowned not by a few of us but all the Veda-s extol you...' This is what is available in Bhagavad-Gita at 15-15 vedaiH ca sarvaiH aham eva vedyo 'by all Veda-s, I alone can be known...' and the Vedic saying tasya naama mahad yashaH is also there.\n'You are a very discriminating person because you are... vicakshiNaH 'because you have eliminated only one scandalous Vali but not the entire race. You yourself said, 'I will eliminate all the demonic race...' when you wanted t punish Ravana the abductor of your wife, when you have seen Seetha's ornaments as at 4-6-25. That analogy is not shown here in Kishkindha. When Sugreeva examined your capacity, you also examined the capacities of Vali and Sugreeva in their first round of fight. Because Sugreeva prayed for your mercy you simply did not kill Vali, but a calculated approach is adopted by you, in the second round, and hence you are very discriminating...'\nYou are kshiti kshamavaan 'earth-like, in endurance...' and as told by Narada to Valmiki kshamayaa pR^ithvii samaH 'in perseverance equals with earth...' Bala Kanda 1-1-18. You are tolerant of us, the other monkeys, though we were on the side of erring Vali. You have not taken us on en masse because of your tolerance.\nYour eyes are blood-streaked like those of an emperor, unlike the bloodshot eyes of a murderer, raamo rakta anta locanaH and kshataja upamaa akshaH for a sovereign should have roseate eyes, mouth and palms... rakta aasya netra paaNiH; tritaamra as per saamudrika shaastra the physiognomic canons. Even though your eyes are reddish, you are not looking like nara-simha man-lion incarnation...'\nThe words like 'ca' 'tu' 'eva' either play a havoc or go in drain in their usage. Here 'ca' is used for six attributes while two more are not suffixed with it. The usage of 'ca' to six of the attributes is to tell that those aspects are available in the Supreme alone. The last two attributes are not suffixed with this 'ca' because these two are Rama's attributes in his personal humanly nature and the Supreme is above these things.\nLeaving all the above to a side for a moment, there is another viewpoint for these aspects. The word 'ca' if taken as 'alone' or 'only' aprameyaH ca becomes 'you are knowable 'only' by your adherents [alone,] despisers cannot know you...' duraasadaH ca becomes 'you are inaccessible to others and accessible 'only' to your adherents [alone...] jitendriyaH ca 'indulgent in your adherents 'only / alone' and by conquering your senses you do not cast your glance at the disavowed...' uttama dhaarmikaH ca 'you are the 'only' supreme Dharma, or you alone is Supreme Dharma...' vicakshanaH ca 'you 'only' can discriminate good from bad, right from wrong... as you alone have said mitra bhaavena sampraaptam na tyajae ayam katham ca na 'I will not leave off one who befriends me...' kshiti kshamavaan ca 'the only/alone forbearing being...' Here also the 'ca' can be brought in as per dehalii diipa nyaaya, the syndrome of 'portico-lamp' a lamp kept in portico beams a little inside the house. Thus Govindaraja comments on this verse.\nShe for a while grasped some divine nature of Rama and in that trance she uttered these expressions about divinity etc. This culminates into the Bhagavad-Gita's saying at 9-11: ava jaananti maam muuDhaa maanuShiim tanum aashritam | param bhaavamajaananto mama bhuuta maheshvaram ||'I the Supreme can not be known by the mindless for I am in human form...' Telling Gita is a happening in a split-second. This is the same condition of Arjuna prior to listening Gita. There also, we are told, that the real time is frozen by Krishna while he rendered those many verses of Gita. After enlightenment by listening Gita, Arjuna proceeds to perform his duty. Here also Tara comes to her real nature of vanara-female, after visualising a kind of vishva ruupa 'the Image of Supreme...' at the time of above addressing, which is not voiced intentionally but sprang forth from her pure consciousness shuddha sattva, while she she continues her wailing and pleading with Rama, at a later time.

A woman is at liberty to remarry under 'certain' circumstances. It appears that Tara is given equally to Vali and Sugreeva by gods, like Draupadi to Pandava-s. But in such wife-sharing system some strict rules are to be observed like time, months, years, turns etc., as has been done by Pandava-s. That was lacking with Vali. Vali's thinking is that Sugreeva wants Tara more than Kishkindha, so Vali did not kill Sugreeva but chased him away from Kishkindha, presuming the begrudging of Sugreeva is too trivial. The actual cause of rivalry between these two is Tara. But this cannot be over stated. Sugreeva informs Rama while narrating episode of Dundubhi, 'due to some woman there was a rivalry...' Sugreeva too does not overstate this.

This is evident when Khara, Duushana, Trishira, Vali, and other opponents confronted Rama. But here Rama querulously spoke of Sugreeva before despatching Lakshmana to Sugreeva. Because Sugreeva is his own adherent and such adherents to duty should not sidetrack themselves into earthly matters when an incredible mission is to be completed by them. That is why Rama came searching for Sugreeva alone basing of the information given by Kabandha.\nIf 'to err is human...' but 'to realize that error and making amends to it is divine...' That is what Sugreeva has done, at the suggestion of Hanuma, saying that: 'You pay deference to him with your forehead-bent...' as at 4-32-21. Sugreeva openly comes out to declare, 'who is he that does not err?' but he equally has the courage to accept what is amiss with him. From this it is concluded, that even if one does wrong, or sins, if he repentantly seeks pardon, his god, any god chosen by that devotee, will pardon him. This is the a kimcinatva 'selflessness in the least...' This is one among the many tenets of sharaNaagati 'dedication...' and this dedication is by manasaa, vacaa, karmaNaa 'by mind, speech and action... or, by body, mind and soul...' That is why Sugreeva says that he has not wronged by vishvaasaat, praNayena, preSyasya i.e., by body, mind or soul... so I am a true dedicate.\nThen it may be asked as to why Lakshmana is enraged at Sugreeva. This is replied in two fold, 1] unable to see his brother's anguish Lakshmana vented out his ire; 2] Lakshmana being a total dedicate he wanted to reprimand the new dedicate Sugreeva and save him from his fickle-mindedness. That is why Lakshmana says sorry for what he has uttered in ire, earlier to the assertion of Sugreeva of his faithfulness. He asks Sugreeva to come to Rama, not to console Rama, but to embolden Rama saying that there is a real adherent in Sugreeva.\n",

            "comment": "The mention of these two western rivers, Saraswati and Sindhu, at this eastern place, to where Vinata is being sent, is a disputed matter. The River Saraswati is the river of Vedic period that once coursed but later disappeared or is coursing underground. This river is 'this creative centre of Man, River Saraswati, was made by the deva-s...' Rig Veda, 3.33.4, and 'all life takes its origin from your [Saraswati womb... Rig Veda, 2-4, 9-17. Presently research work is undertaken to find out this river under the banner 'Saraswati Nadi Shodh Abhiyaan' and they are trying to find out the palaeodrainage, the buried course of this river. It is believed that this perennial river was flowing from Himalayas through Punjab, Haryana, Western Rajasthan, and through the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, and it is said that if this could be traced an abundant source of underground water could be established.\nLikewise, the mention about Sindhu at this place does not relate to westerly Indus River, because any river or rivulet is generally called Sindhu: deshe nada visheSe abdau sindhurnaa sariti striyaam - amara kosha. Sugreeva separately indicates Indus river at 15th verse, chapter 42: sindhu saagarayoH caiva sangame... Hence it is taken as another easterly river called Indusa.\nSo also the river Mahi as said in next verse, on which Griffith says that 'The Mahii River rises in Malwa [Malwa Plateau, Madhya Pradesh, and falls in the Gulf of Cambay after a westerly course of 280 miles...' But the Ancient Geography of India says that 'the mention of this river is out of place here and is probably due to erroneous transposition of the verses...'\nIt is generally accepted that many verses in these episodes of Sugreeva's narrating the geography are shuffled. The River Shona is present day Shon, and Kaushiki is Koshi, and she is the sister of Vishvamitra. That sage explains about the emergence of this river in Bala Kanda.\nVideha is Mithila, the kingdom from where Seetha came to Ayodhya, this and Anga kingdoms were roughly present West Bengal. Magadha is the famous post Buddhist period kingdom, ruling from present-day Bihar. Huen Tsong recorded that 'to the north of Magadha, River Ganga courses, to the west of it Kaashi province is there, and in east hiraNya parvata [Maanghir is there, and in south giraNa suvarNa [singa bhuumi is there... and its capital is kusuma pura [paaTalii putra present day Patna. Next, the word 'koshakaara is literally a silkworm or one who makes scabbards or a lexicographer. It is also referred to the kings of these clans.\n"

Later in time due to tectonic activity, the northern India's landmass rose up and southern sunk down. [Chronology of Ancient Bharath, by Prof. K. Srinivasa Raghavan, published by 'Sri Aurobindo Study Circle, Triplicane, Chennai, in year 1896. It is therefore presumable that the islands of Indian Archipelago are so numerous and so nearly situated. However, this splintering of islands may have happened by the time of Ramayana, since the Sage-poet of Ramayana is citing them as dwiipa, islands.\nRegarding the difference between the names of Yava and Jawa the word ya in Sanskrit becomes ja in vernaculars tadbhava pada. Hence Yava became Java, as simha pruri 'lion-city' became the present day Singapore.\nOn this point of Yava/Java island as said in Ramayana, Sri Kedarnath Basu notes in his 'Hindu Civilization': 'The reader may note here that java dwiipa described as consisting of seven kingdoms was probably the group of islands now called the Indian Archipelago, of which Java was at that time the most powerful. The chief islands of this group are Sumatra, [say, su mitra= good friend, Java, Bali, [the benefactor; Borneo, [or varuNa, the Rain-god, and Celebes.

            "comment": "A controversy is there regarding this statement of Sugreeva. Earlier Sugreeva said, \"Not known is the domain of that sinning demon at all, nor his capabilities... or valour...or even about his sinister dynasty or lineage...\" [4-7-2] And now he is specifically stating that Ravana will be on an island. Then it may be asked whether Sugreeva bluffed to Rama as at 4-7-2, for which it is said that Sugreeva being an intelligent kingly being he did not reveal the truth as an 'official secret.' Otherwise, if Sugreeva told Rama in the first instance where Ravana is, Rama goes straight to Lanka to eliminate Ravana, thereby Sugreeva's politics, i.e., the elimination of Vali or getting Kishkindha, will not work.\nIt is correct that Sugreeva knows that Ravana dwells in Lanka. But on abducting Seetha where is the guarantee that he is still in Lanka along with Seetha. Hence a doubtful situation cannot be stated assertively, that too, to a friend, for it ensues mitra droha 'cheating a friend...'\nOn the other hand, it is said that Sugreeva came to know about the details of Ravana through Tara, because Tara also explains to Lakshmana about the establishment of Ravana. But Sugreeva as the prince regent of Kishkindha and participant in all the activities of the kingdom, knowing about Ravana through Tara is an evasive statement. Hence, it is said that Sugreeva purposefully did not reveal the details about Ravana to Rama, because his own interests are to be met with firstly.\nIn turn it is asked as to why Sugreeva should send so many monkeys to all corners of compass when the kidnapper and his location are known, for which it is said that no thief hides his booty in his own place. Like cat changing the places of kitten, a thief too changes his own place, as well as the place of stolen thing. To justify this, it is said that throughout this and in the previous, and in the next chapters Sugreeva goes on repeating his order, 'search for Seetha and for the residency of Ravana...'\nEven here, Sugreeva is not able to describe the interior of Lanka as he is not well acquainted with it. Rama, who is astounded at this geographical description of Sugreeva, does not ask Sugreeva as to why this particular place of Ravana is not indicated to him earlier. So, the denial of information earlier by Sugreeva is completely political, and now giving orders to search Seetha is for his requital.\n"

Basu records: 'the reader should notice here that Valmiki makes mention of a few places only, most of which are mountains in the west and ends with the poetic land of the setting Sun. This shows that little was known at that time of the famed nations of the west, in spite of the great antiquity claimed by Egypt, Assyria, and Greece and one might be led to the thinking that these nations had not yet risen to power in the time of Valmiki, or if they existed at all, communication was not yet opened between them and the Indian Aryans...'\nThe words a+bhaaskaram, a + maryaadam are also taken in the sense, 'without, enlightenment; without, proper conduct, i.e., propriety...' 'Those places are with primitives who are unenlightened and with impropriety, that are incongruous with Ancient Indian principle of living...' Thus, these cultures west to Persia are held as pre-Babylonian or pre-Assyrian cultures. Moreover, it is assumed that Sugreeva has said this way: 'because Ravana is a highly educated and cultured demon, in his own way, he too despises those lowly cultures despite of his obstinacy. For sure, he will not be there with Seetha, and hence Seetha need not be searched in those countries.'\n"

            "comment": "On seeing the names like this Yavana, Shaka etc., some hold the view that Ramayana was written more later to Greek's invasion on India. Max Muller in his 'What Can India Teach Us?' says: 'If I call the invasion which is generally called the invasion of the Shakas, or the Scythians, or the Indo-Scythians, or Turushkas, the Turanian invasion... who took possession of India, from about first century BC to the third century BC.' Again classifying Sanskrit literature he says, 'we divide the whole of the Sanskrit literature into there two periods, one anterior to the great Turanian invasion, the other posterior to it, we may call the former period as ancient and natural, that of the later modern and artificial.' Thus, Ramayana belonged to the modern and artificial literary period and Veda-s to ancient. According to Indians the Turushkas are not the Scythians but Turkish, and the Yavanas, are clearly the Greek. Michelson in his 'Linguistic Archaisms of the Ramayana...'adds another phase called Epical period. Thus, there are three, Vedic, Epical, and the rest of it is modern and artificial. At the same time Max Muller says: 'At the time of Solomon, there was a channel of communication open between India and Syria and Palestine is established beyond doubt, I believe, by certain Sanskrit words which occur in the Bible such as ivory, apes, peacock, and sandalwood, which, taken together, could not have been exported from any country but India...' So Solomon, Bible, Turanian invasion, Ramayana... all occasioned at one time, i.e., around 0 BC. So many professors, so many researchers have not said a date agreeable to Indians as well as to the world.\nAt one place, it is said that there was a rapport among these places India-Syria-Palestine and even up to Egypt, but at other place, the Indian thought, that the Indian had Greeks and Greeks had Indians, is dismissed. What prevents to agree that both hold up mirror to almost the same culture, though diverse in its practise, right from the belief of Greeks, viz., 'the sense of many gods are there near at hand' to various gods, to their names, to the epical literature, and also to myths and legends and dramas etc, is unknown. But when it comes to dating and mapping 'the earliest date known for certain in Indian history is the invasion of Alexander in 326 BC...' and 'The chronology has been built up form the identification of Sandracrottus of Greek writers with Chandragupta Maurya... yet it is said 'In the seventh century BC India was divided into sixteen Mahajanapada-s...' as per 'An Historical Atlas of Indian Peninsula\", Oxford. Peculiarly those sixteen Janapada-s did not contain the names of Yavana, Shaka provinces in atlases.\n'The Greeks, evidently descended from tribes who had come westwards from the early home of Indo-Europeans in South-Central-Asia, first settled in the land which we know as Greece about 2000 B.C....' according to The Encyclopaedia of Myths and Legends of All Nations, Kaye & Ward Ltd., London. Their history about Ion, the king of Helice, and his war with Elsenians, the confederacy of Lonia in Asia Minor etc., speaks about their origin and shuffling, i.e., from east to west and again from west to east. It is they who have adopted Vedic Rain-god Mitra as their Mithras and many a temple was built all over Europe for Mithras. Even Goddess Lakshmi has Her counterpart in Greece 'Pallas Athene' known as early as 2 B.C., and the comedies of Strattis, like Fragmenta Comic of Greece has Indian fables as early as 400 B.C. Hence, if these Theories of Borrowing are negated with the Theories of Commonality, it would suffice to say that Ramayana is antecedent to the settlement of Greeks in Greece itself.\nWithout lingering on these carbon-testing for the verses of Ramayana that contain Yavana and Shaka named provinces, if the astronomical data available in Ramayana itself is believed, it throws some light on dating. If anybody would care to see the book Vastav Ramayan, by Dr.P.V.Vartak, in Marathi, Vedvidnyana Mandal, Pune, and a web site is available about this, Astronomical Dating of the Ramayana where another approach can be seen, which just does not revolve around one or two names of places. It is said there; 'Therefore, Ramayana 'must have' occurred 9600 years ago, which is 7600 B.C. approximately...' which again is disputable because this is going against the Yuga and Kalpa Theory of Puraana-s, as Ramayana is said to be the legend of Treta Yuga.\nThe provinces Shuurasena, Bharata, Kuru are the downlands of Himalayas. The Kaambhoja is the province northwest to India, where the Russia touches India, as mapped by 'An Historical Atlas of the Indian Peninsula' of Oxford University. Then the Yavana and Shaka should be around there, prior to their migration to the presently known Greece, because Greeks originated from so called 'South-Central-Asia' as called by the historians, and perhaps the historians might be hesitating to call it as 'Himalayan region of India'. They were originally called Ionians, a corrupt or generic name from Indian naming of Yavana or Javana. The word Æoni can be cleaved as a + yoni; [ayogya ] yonim gata 'unbefitting, uterus, obtained birth...' 'one who is born to an unbefitting mother... say, a bastard...' That is what Œdepus Rex proved later. The ethics of these Yavana and Shaka cultures are clearly explained in Karna-Shalya samvaada 'the debate of Karna and Shalya...' in Karna parva, Maha Bharata.\nThe Shakas are again the nomadic tribes inhibiting Central Asia, and they are the Scythes of Greeks and the Indo-Scythians of Ptolemy, inhibited in the Hindu Kush Range of Himalayas. Both of these are categorised under Mleccha people by Ramayana because their ethics do not conform to the Vedic stipulations of living, even though they lived together.\n'The Varadas - The Bengali recension has Daradas instead. They are said to be Dards whose name is still retained in modern Durdstan along the course of the Indus, above the Himalayas, just before it descends to India...' Griffith, Ancient Geography.\nIt may be noticed that Ramayana did not refute any other religion, or sects, or the divergent philosophies of Hinduism itself, but it has agreed that Mleccha-s are there and there is no bother from them. Gods of Ramayana are purely Vedic, unlike the later time, rather modern or artificial literary period's poetry of Kalidasa et al, and their puranic deities like Kali, Uma, and Kumara etc. The literary style of Ramayana is mostly un-Paninian. It has the episodes like Rama-Jaabaali samvaada, where Sage Jaabaali being a nihilist starts preaching nihilism to Rama. When this epic could accommodate information about nihilists' preaching nihilism to Rama, it can as well afford a few lines of information about other philosophies, religions, if they were to be there. Then the present day's Unity in Diversity is not apparent and thus it is being assigned to a post-Vedic period, where Veda-s themselves are not written by some good old sages with white beards, sitting under banyan trees, at any one particular time.\nBecause the ancient history of Greeks came to light firstly, thereby India history is chronicled, and the epic Ramayana is known subsequently, relegating the history of Ramayana later to the Greek's invasion on India, may not be appropriate. History has its own black-ages.\n",

Though Valmiki says nothing extraordinary, commentators attach many good reasons and attributes to this episode. After the two foots of verse 4-4-12 the following foot is traditionally read, in affection.\nThat is to say suvarNasya 'golden ring...' su varNasya 'greatly glittering...' su-varNasya 'good lettered...' 'That ring is golden, that too highly glittering, [rather high in carats, maybe 48 carats,] and has very good letters on it...' That ring has one jewel on upper side and two jewels below that. The upper jewel has a carving of the letter shri and lower two raa, ma... so goes the tradition.\nWhen Rama abdicated everything and no other jewellery is evident on his body, though his bow and arrows have golden finishing, then why this lone ring is still there with him - is the debatable question. This indicates the custom of exchanging rings in marriage. This is the ring got prepared by Seetha in her kingdom Mithila and she herself put it on Rama's finger in their marriage as vara varaNa 'selecting the wooer...' When Hanuma gives this ring to Seetha in Sundara Kanda the reaction of Seetha is: gR^ihiitvaa prekShamaaNaa saa bhartR^i kara vibhuuShaNam | 'on taking the adornment of her husband's hand she looked at it...' at 5-36-4.\nThis ring to men is almost like the mangala suutra 'the sacred marriage-time pendant of Hindu ladies. Thus, none can ask a man to remove his wedding ring as long as his wife is alive and attached.\nNext, 'in giving such ring to Hanuma, bypassing the troop leader Angada, Rama slighted the imperial protocol...' and 'Sugreeva being a king why eulogise Hanuma this much, a simple minister? Is it to deify Hanuma? This is another objection. For this Dharmaakuutam gives a vivid and extensive commentary, saying it is not at all a violation of protocol. The objection is:\nna anvatra yuvaraaje bala adhyakShe a~Ngade sati hanumataH svatantratayaa puraskaaraH abij~naana pradanaadikam ca anucitam-'when prince regent Angada is there, entrusting some work to Hanuma independently, that too after eulogising him, is unbefitting...' This is countered by the commentator saying that:\nevam ca avishvasaniiyam angadam apahaaya vishvasaniiyo hanumati bishShyua puraskaaraadikam yuktam eva |-'still Angada has not gained the confidence of the king, though he is anointed as prince regent, thus entrusting a piece of work to Hanuma by Sugreeva is reasonable...' Then the counter-question is 'why Angada is anointed as prince regent, at all...' for this it is said:\ntathaa ca angadasya j~naatitvaat avishvasaniiyatvaat aparityaagena rakShaNiiyatvaadviniitam vidhaaya yauva raajye abhiShecaniiyatvaat ca rakShaNa yauvaraajya abhiShecana kaarya niyojanaadikam - mantiNaH ca hanumataH sakala kaaryeShu vishvasaniiyasya svaatnatreNa puraskaaraadikam yuktam eva | 'a blood relation is to be anointed as a prince regent to look after the affairs of the kingdom, and here too, Angada is nominated as the troop leader of the expedition to look after the safety of this particular troop, and it does not preclude the king to entrust certain work to some of his true believable adherents...' This being so, Angada also expresses his resentment against Sugreeva and openly criticises Sugreeva at the end of this canto on similar lines, when they are unable to leap the ocean.\n",

Maayaavi and Dundubhi are brothers and sons of Maya. Maheshvara Tiirtha says because Dundubhi is the son of buffalo-demon Maya, i.e., Dundubhi Sr., thus he can be called as Dundubhi. And Govindaraja says:\ndundubheH puurvajaH agrajaH sutaH mayasya iti seShaH vakShyatu uttara kaaNDe mayaH - maayaavii prathamaH staat dundubhiH tat anantaram iti...  'Maayaavi is the first son and the second one is Dundubhi- as said by Maya in Uttara Kanda...' Then it is assumed that both Maayaavi and Dundubhi have come in the first instance for a fight with Vali. But on seeing Vali and Sugreeva, Dundubhi might have entered into the cave with Maayaavi and somehow escaped from there, and thus only Maayaavi is killed by Vali. Later Dundubhi came at the gate of Kishkindha and was killed by Vali. Hence, Sugreeva's referring to Dundubhi here includes both Maayaavi and Dundubhi.\n"

Here the monkeys on duty have entered a black hole, saw an unreal world, and are on the verge of hunger-deaths, and they want release from the three, viz., darkness, unreality and death. Then a real being Swayamprabha, with her own self-luminosity appeared and gave them the real food, saved them from mortality and led them to luminance from 'their' darkness, rather than from the 'cavity's' darkness.\nThe entry of monkeys into a gloom is the pathless search in their duty, seeing an unreal world is deeming their search as unreal, rather meaningless, and hunger-death is not in their physical aspect, it is the hungering for finding Seetha, as Swayamprabha alone says tarasvinaH vaanaraaH ' mighty monkeys...' as such they are they can sustain for some more days or months without food, but they are mortal and their hope of finding Seetha is now subjected to mortality. In view of these facts they needed a torch, a beacon, a blind-lamp in blinding darkness, called a 'way-out for Seetha's search...'\nHanuma is not that diffident a monkey to speak very humble pleasantries as at verses 16 and 17. He addressed the sainted lady, 'as you have led us to light from darkness, also saved us from physical deaths, lead us unto reality, truth, a correct way to reach our destination and let this dying hope in search become immortal in finding Seetha...' Accordingly, Swayamprabha being a godsend transported them to the southerly side of the cavity, avoiding other directions. If they are transported to northern side they have to return to Kishkindha, only to die at the hand of Sugreeva. Why she has transported them to southern side is because, she is sarvaj~na an 'all-knower...' knower of past, present and the future course of Ramayana. On this southern side there is an ocean and whether to cross it or die on that seashore is up to the monkeys. As a torchbearer and illuminator of the gloomy thoughts of monkeys, her role-play is over and she retunes to her cavity. In the next few chapters the monkeys quarrel among themselves, but Hanuma is the only one to learn lesson from Swayamprabha's action in transporting them to this end of ocean, takes lead in future events. Hence, Swayamprabha led Hanuma to the three positives, the truth, luminescence, and liveness of their mission.\n",

Thus, when we are scheduled meticulously by days and months we are not supposed to be unaware of the time factor.'\nThe Indian months are twelve : caitra -vaishaakha - jyeShTa -aashaaDha - shraavaNa - bhaadrapada - aashviiuja - kaartiia margashiirsha - pouSha - maagha - phaalguNa ---The year cycle as per these months is given at the endnote of Bala 12th chapter. Some take this aashviiyuja maase as kaartiika maasa by deciphering this maasi as saamiipya suuchaka adhikaraNa saptami 'because of the proximity it is taken in seventh case...' and thus say this as the end part of kaartiika maasa and Sugreeva ordered maarga shira maasa for searching Seetha, and one intervening month puSya is lapsed in cavity, thus this is phalguNa maasa.

His first wife is Ilabila from whom he got Kubera as son. Second wife is Sumaali's daughter Kaikasi. Lady Kaikasi gave birth to three sons Ravana, Kumbhakarna, and Vibheeshana. The third wife of Vishravas is puShpotkaTa, the sister of Kaikasi, and this Pushpotkata gave birth to Mahodara, Paarshvaada and others whom we meet in Great War canto. Vishravasa's fourth wife is the other sister of Kaikasi, named Raaka, who gave birth to Suurpanakha.\nRavana's wife and empress of Lanka is Mandodari, the daughter of Maya, the son of Diti. Mandodari's characterisation vies equally with Seetha, Savitri, Anasuuya, Ahalya, Draupadi, and with other great ladies. Her name has some significance. When Shurpanakha was claiming herself a befitting female for Rama, and belittling Seetha she uses words like krishodari, shaatodari meaning 'a female with feeble womb... So also manda udari means 'slow, womb... and hence she is lady with slow conception...' Mandodari gives birth to one Indrajit, son of Ravana, an extraordinary fighter, and all-conquering warrior. Had Mandodari given birth to one or two more Indrajit-s, a dozen Rama-s have to take incarnation. Indrajit's wife is Sulocana, another lady of high nobility and chastity, counted on par with other husband-devout ladies like Seetha.\n",

On one hand, Rama gave his golden ring to Hanuma in the presence of these very same monkey heroes, and on the other Angada is asking all the other monkeys to jump over the ocean. Hanuma is fully aware that all the other monkeys are somehow escaping the situation, not because they cannot jump just a hundred yojana ocean, but owing to the fear of Ravana. Hanuma neither fears Ravana nor cares his stooge-demons, but his concern himself with his duty. If somebody comes forward to leap, then it is well and good and Hanuma has to accompany that monkey as a standby, because he is handling the ring of Rama. If none comes forward, even in that event he has go to Lanka unaccompanied. In either case it is Hanuma who has to go, hence the 'comfortableness' is 'decisiveness' and thus he is decided of his duty.

Or even that stooge of Ravana, namely Akampana, who rushes to Ravana to carry the news of annihilation of Khara, Dushana and others, and he even comes to Ravana before Shurpanakha crossing ocean without difficulty. However, Ravana is the lone one who uses a chariot-like aircraft that brays like a supersonic jet. In such a case an objection is raised in questioning - 'are they not speedier than Hanuma? ' It is not so, it is said, the effort and preparation of Hanuma are on the level of earthly beings, whereas the artifice of Ravana with tricks and trickery, with more tricky and technical aircrafts of demons, is an infra-mundane action, if not witchery and wizardry. No doubt, Ravana's machines and vehicles are the derivatives of Atharvana Veda, but they are all counterproductive, revulsive, and phobic to the wellbeing of society. Uncongenial to atmosphere and thus unwelcome stratagems. And here it is said by Hanuma, one to too many times 'I will do it by the speed of my arms, thighs and calves...' etc., which itself is reflective of his innate, inherent, personal traits, talents, and capabilities, than more technical or contrived paraphernalia of the demons. Hence, Hanuma is identified as a self-assured, self-active, self-propelling dedicatee to duty, and his flight is on a separate footing.\n",
