Further there is a method described in dhanurveda as to how a bowstring is to be fastened to the other end of the bow. The Indian mythological bows are of six feet or two yards, in height. It is also a measure like horse length. The string, which so far is spiralled to the bow beam, is to be removed. Then the bottom end of the bow is to be kept pressed onto the ground with left foot's big toe. Then with the right hand the edge of the string is handled and with left hand the other end of the bow is to be held and crouched, so that the string can be hooked or fastened there. After fastening, the stretch of the string is to be tested [like the occasional testing of the badminton or tennis racquet for the tension of its gut,] by pulling and leaving it, so that it makes a warring sound. By this sound of the bowstring, which is a signal to the opponent, the opponent comes to know as to who is handling which bow. Then if the archer is going to beam out an arrow, he shall pull the arrow on the bowstring up to his right ear and leave it, aakarNaanta prayoga . Here, removing the bowstring from its fastening implies that this archer, namely Rama who is so far handling the stringed bow, for he is roaming in forests, and since he is entering the place of elderly saints now, unfastened the bowstring in all his humbleness to sages and saints.\n"

In the next canto Kishkindha, Vali the monkey hero questions Rama, as who he is to enter Kishkindha. To that Rama replies, \"All the Bharata continent belongs to us, the Ikshwaku-s, and presently the emperor is Bharata, and hence on behalf of my emperor Bharata I slay you.\" There he is again confident of returning to capital after completing his exile. Hence claiming this kingdom as 'my' kingdom does not alter his status of emperor, though not now, but after the completion of exile he is to become one. Again Rama weighed the agony in terms of his father's death and grabbing away of his kingdom. Raajya Lakshmi, Kingdom Wealth is nothing before his wife, Wealth of Fortune, i.e. Bhaagya Lakshmi.

[3-2-26]\nThe forest Dandaka Forest wherein Rama is trekking is a dominion of their kingdom, but a deserted forest. One named Danda, the last son of Ikshvaku, was performing all demonic activities in their kingdom. His father Ikshvaku received many a complaint about Danda's deeds from his subjects, and angered at his erring son Danda and banishes him from the kingdom.\nDanda took refuge in Vindhya mountain range and built a kingdom and a beautiful capital for himself called Madhumanta. He rubbed shoulders with all the demons thereabout and thus became a disciple of Sage Shukraachaarya, the guru of demons. One day when Sage Shukraachaarya is not in hermitage, Danda reaches there, and sees Araja, the elder daughter of the sage Shukra, and molests her, in spite of her repeated protests. Later when Sage Shukraachaarya comes to know about it, gets enraged and curses Danda, to fall down along with his entire kingdom under a mud storm around that Madhumanta capital for a period of seven consecutive days.\nThen there is a mud storm for seven days and entire kingdom went under mud, later to become a forest called Dandaka. The place to where the curse fearing people fled from that Madhunata to further south is called Jansthaana. At later time, when Rama's peregrination started, these two places, Dandaka forest and Janasthaana, are under the domain of Ravana, and Ravana made one demon named Khara, as the protector of this dominion Jansthaana.\nThis is the place where Rama built his hermitage Panchavati, at which Demoness Surpanakha arrives, and from where Ravana abducts Seetha. When Rama asks the forest dwelling sages for a quiet place to live on, the sages in Dandaka forest, will make Rama constantly move southward, till he reaches Janasthana, indirectly directing Rama to eradicate the demonic influence over these places, which once belonged to Rama's kingdom.\n",

Of them gandharva-s are amiable beings for their expertise in performing arts. The apsara beings are the divine courtesans and among them are four apsara beings of high order. They are Rambha, Urvashi, Menaka and Tilottama . These four are instrumental to Indra, to incite and allure sages from their austere penance, lest they may win over the ship on heavens from Indra. The present gandharva, namely Tumburu, in his courting with Rambha had belated his services to Kubera, the Chief Divinity for Wealth Management. Hence Kubera cursed this gandharva to become the demon called Viradha, but yet this Tumburu alias Viradha is the devotee of Goddess Lakshmi. The antagonists of sura are a-sura beings and all sorts of demons, monsters, etc., come under this category and they are not devils or Satan's stooges, but they equal the capabilities of sura beings. Prof. Ranade observes that \"Dr. R.G. Bhandarkar, in an important article in the B.Br.A.S. Journal makes the following interesting suggestion.

[3-4-34]\nThe episode of Viraadha assumes some importance in Hindu mythology. It may be observed that Viraadha drops down Seetha, lifts and carries Rama and Lakshmana far away from Seetha, where Rama and Lakshmana kill Viraadha. aadhyaatma raamaayana which occurs in the  chapter 61 of brahmaanmda puraana also narrates this episode of Viradha as a one to one fight, herein Rama affronts and kills him straight. But in Valmiki Ramayana, Viradha takes away Seetha first and then Rama and Lakshmana, too. A question arises as to why the demon should snatch Seetha away and later carry Rama and Lakshmana to a distant place from Seetha. It is part of the scheme that Rama kills no demon or sinner in the presence of Seetha, including Ravana, for she is that benevolent one to all the sinners and pardons them if surrendered in faith at her feet, as an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi. Our concern here is with skaanda purana , a Shiva Puraana, in which Viradha's episode is explained detailedly. The skaanda puraana puts it as:\nOn seeing Seetha Viraaadha thought, \" She is the Supreme goddess through whom heavens can be obtained by salvation and also release from the bondage [of demon's body ] On just seeing Her, relieved is this body cage, so with all my devotion, I steal Her .\" etc. Hence vi raadha meant to be verily, devout, like Radha of Krishna. When chased and hurt by Rama and Lakshmana, the demon releases Seetha, but carries both the brothers away. For this distancing Rama and Lakshmana from Seetha, it is said that Rama does not kill any demon in the presence of Seetha, for she graciously condones the mischief of the demons, if they are true devotees.\nAgain in skaanda puraana, at the end of this Viraaadha episode, the phala shruti [Fruit of Listening] it is narrated as:\n",
            "comment": "The simile of sun and moon is of some importance. It will not be clear as to, who is compared with Sun and who with Moon, unless some ancient commentaries are touched. Rama is compared with Chandra, the Moon, because, Moon will not travel without his wives. All the celestial stars are the wives of the Moon, and they twinkle before the Moon's arrival, in order to welcome him into the night. Hence Rama is suffixed with Chandra, compounding to Sri Ramachandra. On the other hand, Sun does not travel along with his wife, namely Chaya, the Shadow, but she always will be at his hind. We the living beings are in between the Sun and his wife Chaya. If we face Sun in the morning times, she will be at our back, and in the evenings, when the Sun is at our back, Chaya, shadow will be in front of us, reminding us of our lengthening shadow of life. Thus we are in between the light and shadow. The Sun is also called karma saakshi, [Witness of Deeds.] Our own shadow, shortens with the ascending Sun and lengthens as the dusk of our day or life increases. Hence Sun's travel is wife-less one, and Lakshmana is thus compared with the Sun, for he does not have his wife travelling with him now. And Lakshmana is another karma saakshi [Witness of Events] in the Ramayana. In another way of commenting it is said that both of them are said to be moon-like in their appeasing personalities and sun-like in their radiant valour.\n",

All these Sages and Saints show only one path that Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana have to travel, i.e., towards Ravana, the evil on earth. From here they are directed to Sage Suteekshna's hermitage, there from to Sage Agastya's hermitage, and there from, to still deeper place in forests, called Panchavati. According to Kaikeyi's banishment Rama need not travel this far, but could have resided in some near-about forests of River Ganga. But one after the other, either demons who became celestials or sages who are going to become divinities, all usher Rama southward, i.e., towards the dominions of demons, whom Rama has to eradicated from earth. 'If Rama were to enter into Panchavati, a powerful dominion of demons like Khara and Dushana, alleging their loyalties to Ravana, it is definite that an encounter will ensue and Rama will start eradicating one after the other, and ultimately ending with Ravana...' this appears to be the logic of all the sages. As such Rama is asked to go on travelling towards the evil side of the earth, for all of the sages know about Rama's destination\n"

[3-9-33]\nThis particular chapter is an interesting juncture in Ramayana, where Seetha reminds about the question of triggering cause for Rama's waging a war against demons. Seetha's doubt is well explained in Dharmaakuutam, the encyclopaedic commentary on Ramayana. A number of pages are allotted there for this chapter, and it is said there, that if Seetha is said to be self-contradictory in telling Rama that bow and arrows are a must to Kshatriya-s to protect the helpless when saying 'safeguard the sufferers, then only Kshatriya-s should use their bow...\" as at verse 3-9-26 above, and also questioning immediately at 3-9-27, 'where the Kshatriya dharma, where the hermit's way of living...' etc., dharmaakuutam says not so. She is not contradicting herself in her statements, but asking Rama to have a cause, without resorting to weaponry against those demons, in a straightforward way. ataH tad rakShaNaaya aayudhamna graahyam iti etad abhipraayakatvaat ||\nShe is inquisitive to know why Rama alone shall raise the bow and arrows against some demons hurting some sages. These sages are having super powers and Indra like celestial chiefs are coming to these sages to take them to heaven with their mortal bodies. Can't they eliminate these demons? But these super hermits are not going to heaven, which is the minimum ambition of any penance, but requesting Rama to protect them from demons. And Rama obligingly started to wage this unilateral war, where any war requires a triggering point. Can't the super sages eliminate these demons, with their powers acquired by their penances? This is the question of Seetha. For this, Rama replies so convincingly in the next chapter, saying that the sages cannot issue forth a curse at the demons, in the course of their penance.\nSage Vishvamitra, though being a furious sage, once sought the help of Rama to counter the Demoness Tataka. And Rama rendered it. Now also these sages do not waste their powers at the mischievous demons, but ask Rama to safeguard their interests, for Rama is the king, whether he may be in capital or in forests.\nSecondly, Rama is subjected to the throne of Ayodhya, now being held by his brother Bharata, and as a loyalist to that throne, Ram should act in accordance with the rules of his kingdom. This area Dandaka forests is under the ambit of their own kingdom. So Rama has to perform the deeds suitable to their kingdom. When killing Vali, Rama speaks to Vali -- \"all this area is under our kingdom, now held by Bharata, and it is my duty to act in accordance with the decree of that throne...\"\n\"Regarding the cause, Seetha's doubt comes true and she alone becomes the ultimate cause for Rama, to wage the final war with Ravana.\n",

The Om is the compound of three letters a + u + ma, and the first letter in the verse is a , in a + grataH. The second letter of Om, i.e., u is u in su sobhanaa. Other versions may read this as su madhyamaa , even then this u is there. The letter before last word ha is ma , as in jagaa ma . These three letters put together are Om. So the three, Rama, Lakshmana, Seetha are compared with these three letters of Om.\nVishnu/Rama is in letter a and he is coursing ahead, agrartaH prayayau , followed by u, Lakshmi/Seetha, who is an embodiment of the Absolute's karuNa , benevolence, as said at lakshmyaa kaaruNya ruupayaa And she is the illusory aspect of that Absolute, Maya, yaamaa ye m� , and being so, she will be the veil in between that Absolute and Innate Soul. The last letter ma is makaaro jiiva vaacaka, makaaro daasa vaacaka, is the sign for the servitude of the Innate Soul to the Absolute. That is what Lakshmana is.\nAnd anu jagaama means that which follows without any I-ness or Mine-ness as a total surrender, kainkarya . This agrataH prayayau raamaH is said to be the leadership quality of Soul, or Rama, where he does it himself without preaching, like Krishna. Previously when they entered forests, Lakshmana was leading and showing the way, as a dutiful servant. During next phase all three walked in line. Now, Rama wanted to wage war with demons, thus he leads the way, keeping Seetha in centre, followed and guarded by Lakshmana. This is the view point of the sages following them, for they the sages always meditate about that Absolute, in terms of Om, and these three appeared as the three letters of Om.\n",

By its nature it grows day by day, and stands first to be saluted by the rising sun in east every day. Jealous of this Mt. Meru, Mt. Vindhya started to rise to exceed the height of Mt. Meru, thus obstructing the sun's path. Then the day changed for night and the travel of Sun and Moon, the performance of Vedic rituals, which are bound by the solar lunar movement, went topsy-turvy. Then the gods prayed Agastya to do something to decrease the height of Mt. Meru. Agastya and his wife then were coming to Mt. Vindhya and seeing its height, he requested Mt. Vindhya, \"Oh, Mountain King Vindhya, myself and my wife are going southward, and we are not able to climb this much height... kindly lower yourself, so that we old people climb you and go to the other side...\" Mt. Vindhya being an ardent worshipper of sages and saints immediately lowered his height to the ground level, so that the old couple need not climb but just walk over him. Agastya and his wife on coming to the southern side of the mountain again requested Mt. Vindhya to be at this height only, for they will be returning soon to north. Mt. Vindhya readily agreed for that also, and it is lying like that even today. Because Agastya did not return to north on coming to south Mt. Vindhya is still believed to be at ground level. Thus the solar and lunar movement, seasons' revolve, Vedic calendars etc. are again put to normalcy. Thus the name Agastya, aga stha mountain, stopper, agam sthaasyati or, stabhnaati iti agastyaH. He played an important role in uplifting southern regions of India, namely Dravidian cultures. Hid wife is Lopaamudra, the saintly lady will be quoted in Lalitha Sahasra Naamaavali.

Rama is said to have asked Lakshmana to inform the sage that karta subject to eliminate -  himself; and the object, or the instrument to eliminate Ravana, namely Seetha have come. Rama says in above verses that he would like to spend rest of the exile here in this hermitage. But Sage Agastya later asks him to proceed to Panchavati, i.e., towards the dominions of demons. For that and for keeping the sage informed about the arrival of time to eradicate Ravana, Rama seeks this protocol.\n",

Further, Lakshmana is saying this in presence of Seetha, siitaa samakSe, because if she is not going to accept that place, Rama rejects it. Hence, it firstly is the choice of Seetha on which Rama's approval will be automatic. Thus the question of agreeability or disagreeability of Lakshmana does not arise. 'Even in this incarnation in the dynasty of Kakutstha as Rama, I am still subservient to you, as I was in vaikuNTha , as aadi sheSa . And this tvayi varSa shatam sthite : shata is lexically a hundred but also used in its infinitude, thus 'I am anytime servant of yours.' svayam tu ruchire deshe : 'Your choice of place is but my pleasure.' This is to portray the self-denial of Lakshmana, apart from any individual identity let alone the devotee status, total dedication kainkarya, to the Supreme. This is according to Govindaraja.\nAdherent nature of Lakshmana is also like that of a younger brother towards his elder brother, for the elder brother becomes father-like after the demise of their father. anenapiturantaram yaavat jyeShTho jiivati taavat kaniShThasya na svaatantryam itisuucitam | tathaa ca manuH piteva paalayat sutaan jyeShTha bhraataa yaviiyasaH| putravat ca api varteran jyeShTho bhraatari dharmataH || dharmaakuutam.\n"

Whether an epic avowed to reflect the Vedic import, as said at 1-4-6, vedopabR^ihmaNaarthaaya , and that which is pious and merited puNyam vedaischa samamatam at 1-1-98, should have accounts on seasons is the question. For this is said that relating niceties of season time and again, is in perfect accord with Veda, for the season and time are subservient to all Veda-s as per the ancillary of Veda, the Astrology, veda-anga : jyotiShya . Veda-s themselves say that the year is the soul of the horse of Ashvameda. uShaa vaa ashvasya medhasya shiraH | sa~Nvatsara aatmaashvasya medhasya | -- yajurveda bR^ihadaaraNyaka Hence time and season are the mind and soul of all Veda-s.\nLike this we find beautification of four seasons at four places, for e.g., hemanta spring is narrated in starting of Kishkindha. And vasanta post autumnal season is described in Kishkindha 43rd chapter, when Hanuma and others are in search for Seetha, and after their exit from the cave of Swayamprabha. varSa rainy season is portrayed in 28th chapter of Kishkindha. At every possible occasion, all the rituals, daily routines that are time oriented, do explain the importance of time than the importance of ritual or daily routine. It is said: vedopabR^ihmaNaartham pravR^itte asmin granthe veda vihita karma apekShita kaala visheSha nirNaayakatvaat kaala saadhaaraNa lakShaNa pratipaadanam eva tat tat R^itu varNana vyaajena kR^itam iti dharmopayoga sambhavaat | -- saayam kaalaadi cihna pratipaadanam iti etat sarvam karma anuShTaana upayukta kaala j~naapanaartham eva kR^itam iti dharma paryavasaanam sambhavati eva -- dharmaakuutam\nThus dharma is upheld in all these narratives about the season and time, which aspect is upheld by the commentators and they too comment lengthily whenever a season or time factor occurs.\n",

The episode Shuurpanakha is considered to have haasya rasa, comic relief. Refusing the unnecessarily joking of Rama some say that Shuurpanakha came there with an exquisite form. And what all said negatively about her in preceding verses is the implicit idea of the poet. Taking the entrance of Shuurpanakha with a beautiful personality every cinema that is shot on Ramayana gives a cabaret dance with inciting song to Shuurpanakha at this situation.\nIn some other mms there are a few more verses that contain a situation where Jatayu comes to Rama to take leave of him to go and see his relatives and bird-friends, after Rama returns from the river. Then, knowing that Jatayu is not there Shuurpanakha enters the cottage area with a guise of winsome beauty. No demon or demoness can approach that cottage of Rama, as long as Jatayu is there - is the point for establishment. While the difference in mms/texts is between one or two letters like, na hi taavat manoj~na angii and tvam hi taavat manoj~na angii , whether the poet entered Shuurpanakha in a fashionable getup or as an old female is another point that remained inconclusive.\n"

The implicit meaning is akR^ita daaraH 'one without a wife now or one who does not take another wife.' apuurva bhaaryayaa by first wife alone, arthii he is desired; shiilavaan, eka patnii vrata shiila vantaH an abider in the syndrome of 'one-man-one-wife.' priya darshanaH 'in dear ones, tend towards; tending towards his dear ones.' te.abhrtaa= te + a + bhartaa 'for you, no, husband; he is no husband of yours, he can never be your husband.' anu ruupaH 'fit for his own wife.' asya ruupasya yogya bhaviSyati? 'with this kind of, aspect of yours for you with such a notorious aspect, will he be eligible to become your husband? No, he will not.' Maheshvara Tiirtha.\nThe word apuurvi is categorised under rare and unfamiliar words. It is said that as per rock edicts it is a traveller, brahmacaari celibate, who is studying apuurva, namely Veda-s. As mimaamsikaa-s tell us that apuurva is divineness, results from Vedic knowledge. Here the celibate state of Lakshmana is said to have been referred, 'though he is having his wife Urmila, he is undergoing celibacy.' And further 'In Gorresio's text it is there as taruNo bhaaryayaa ca arthii where taruNa is youthfulness. Rama is also youthful. So Rama's expression of apurvii is just to indicate Lakshmana as a brahmacaari a celibate, though he has a wife and youthful also. After Prof. Satya Vrat. Unchained is he by nuptial bands: is Griffith's wording.\n"

This taruNau ruupa sampannau is in accordance with Rama's aspect which will be sadaiva priya darshanaH   'the same pleasant persona at any time' as in Bala Kanda at 1-1-16, as said by Sage Narada to Valmiki. This is the same situation with Hanuma when Seetha asks him to indicate some aspects of Rama so as to believe Hanuma. There Hanuma starts with raamaH kamala patra akshaH sarva sattva manoharaH - sundara 35-8. 'Rama is lotus-petal eyed one' Further people in sleep, intoxicated or infuriated conditions, will speak their heart supramatta kupitaanaam bhaava j~naanam dR^iSTaH So Shuurpanakha who is also in a sleep like daze, she came out with her soulful feelings about Rama.\nThis narration has threefold meaning. 1] Through the eyes of a lustful female; 2] To belittle Rama and Lakshmana's prowess only to extol Kara's pride; 3] To deride Khara's valour so that he gets incited to fight Rama and Lakshmana.\ntaruNau 'came of age.' kanyaam varayate ruupam Women's first criterion towards a man is age. But this wording is in dwivacana 'in duel number' so it belongs to both Rama and Lakshmana. Then the question comes 'is she leaning towards both of them?' Yes. She makes eyes at both. First she approached Rama, but he advised her to approach Lakshmana. Lakshmana in turn advises her to approach Rama, thus she got interest in both. This is as per anyonya sadR^ishau viirau   'those darers are similar to one another.' Rama and Lakshmana may be different among themselves, but to the onlookers they appear as one reality. Further, she has hate-thinking for both of them also. She says that 'this situation occurred due to both of them' as at 3-19-18. How can she fall after both at a time? She can, with 'either-or-single-or-both' syndrome because she is a demoness, and unseen are such brothers with their glorious aspects, so far by her.\nruupa sampannau 'their aspects are ravishing' The syndrome is that angaat angaat sambhavasi 'offshoots derive parent's aspects.' So Manmatha, the Love-God derived all his aspects from Vishnu. Then it is imaginable how much more that Vishnu might be in his lovely aspect. So Rama is with niratishaya ruupa samR^iddhi   'sublime features, endowed with' that which can be borrowed even by Manmatha.\nsukumaarau 'delicate' like flowers. Rama is said to equal a delicate flower. asiita puSpa samkaasham Rama's body itself is a flower that which can be cherished by all. Or su = excellent; ku =of earth; maarau = Manmatha-s' 'two Manmatha-s on earth' Manmatha, is only one god of love and without any form or body parts, but these two are having excellent forms and are evident on earth before eyes as per the attribute of kandarpa iva muurtimaan 'he has a form like that of Love-god'\nThen her bother Khara may ask 'then why we demons shall hanker after some flimsy, fragile, feeble creatures?' For that she says mahaa balau 'greatly vigorous.' They have un-depleting vigour of manhood, which is what required by an aged demoness.\npuNDariika vishaala akshau 'white-lotus, broad, eyed' 'Their eyes are not like ours while our eyes are samrakta nayanaa ghoraa 'bloodshot eyes of terrible look'\nOr, unlike tamo guNa udreka 'ever persisting with stolid constituent of nature' and unlike rajo guNodreka 'ever energetic with sprightly constituent of nature' -- their eyes are sattva guNa sampanna 'serene with the pure constituent of nature' Though Rama says that he aatmaanaam maanuSyam manye 'in my soul I consider I am human' but as per shruti / scripture, yathaakapyaasam puNDariikam evam akshiNii 'though his outward aspect is hiding his real Being, his eyes are telling the truth of His supernal nature', hence Rama is other-worldly.\nOr his white broad eyes are comparable with kshiira samudra Milky-ocean, his abode, with its unfathomable depths, so is his heart.\nOr mahaa balau puNDariika vishaala akshau 'Great mighty and white broad eyed ones' who by their great might annihilate vice and if the evildoer submits himself, their white eyes alone give salvation with a broad-mind. sukumaarau puNDariika vishaala akshau 'Manmatha-like, white, broad eyed'\nIf it is said that these two are Love-gods on earth, then it may be asked 'where are the flowery arrows of that Love-god to these two?' But the arrows of these earthly Love-gods are their eyes and glances. The lotus is but one among the five arrows of Manmatha. Even Seetha under her direly distressed situation in Lanka says that 'gods, celestials, great-souls et al are sanctified with the look of this lotus-petal eyed one' dhanyaa devaaH sa gandhavaaH siddhaaH ca paramarSyaH | mama pashyanti ye naadhama raamam raajiiva locanam || sundara 26-41. This verse takes its place in gayatri ramayaNa as its 14th verse out of total 27 verses.\nFurther they are excelling only by their nature but not by their dressings and outfits for they are just clad in ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau 'jute-cloths, deerskin wearers of' Mahaakavi Kalidasa says in his abhij~naana shaakuntalam: says iyam [shakuntala] adhika manoj~naa valkalena api tanvii that, 'this Shakuntala is pleasant though clad in jute-cloths' kimavahi madhuraaNaam maNDananam na akR^itiinaam 'nothing can beautify beautiful people' etc. Though not adorned by any extra special ornamentation they by their nature are attractive, as discerned by sages at 3-1-13 of Aranya Kanda ruupa samhanam lakshmiim saukumaarya suveSatam as well by this Shuurpanakha or even by Ravana in part II of Yuddha Kanda, in 99th chapter 12th verse, who also extols these lotus eyes and the aspect of Rama on his first sight at Rama as padma patra vishaala aksham diirgha baahum arindamam\nShould Khara ask in fear 'who is that great-mighty one who mutilated a sister of a great demon like me? Thereby my fear is growing about my own existence.' Then Shuurpanakha's reply is like this, in order to remove Khara's fear of Rama:\ntaruNau  'youngsters, boys' for his own father Dasharatha tells Vishvamitra that these are uuna Sodasha varshau; na yuddha yogyatam asya apashyaami in Bala Kanda. Shuurpanakha that way tells Khara 'brother Khara... these two Rama and Lakshmana are boyish you need not care them, ' Further yauvane viSayaisiNaam 'boys in young age bother more for enjoymentï -- they are bothered to enjoy life and are not yet fit for a war, so you can war with them'\nruupa sampannau 'just by getups they are brilliant, but lack in courage to confront you' kanyaa kaamayet ruupam 'girls cherish charming ones' 'They fall after girls only with their charming aspects that are unworthy to withstand war, so you can war with them'\nsukumaarau 'delicate or fragile, or flimsy,' because they are sons of some king, grown up in palace chambers, unlike us who grow in ravines; and they eat nonsensically delectable food, unlike us who happily eat raw-flesh. So, wherefrom they can tolerate your bloodshot glances, let alone your arrows...'\nmahaa.abalu = mahaa + a + balau   'very, without, strength; very weak fellows';\nfurthermore mahaa abalau; mahatii rakshaNiiyaa abalaa yayostu 'a lady, namely Seetha, is to be protected by them. She has become a string fastened around their necks. Then how do they, the sentinels of a woman, can fight you...'\npuNDariika vishalaa akshau 'paled, broadened, eyed' 'Their eyes paled and wide-open awaiting the results of their scarring my nose and ears, and their eyes popped up in daze, then what can they do to you...'\nThen Khara may ask, \"it is good you have said that they are hapless etc., but they may now muster up some army and fight me back then what?'\nFor this she says, ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau 'wearers of jute-cloths and deerskin' And furthering her argument she says, 'how can they afford an army for they themselves have nothing special to wear. That too one of those items, namely the jute-cloth, is begged from a tree that is sessile, and the other, the deerskin, is begged from a deer, that is mobile.  They themselves are shuttling in between mobile and sessile how can they confront you.'\nFurther, this god, say this Rama, has no other special work or duty, except shuttling between mobile or sessile beings or matter, begging their produce, and beg them to recognise him.\nHer words also extol the capabilities of Rama and Lakshmana in warring and said to have addressed Khara this way in order to enhance his self-pride.\ntarunau; yauvane vijigiisuNaam 'youthful ones are interested in triumphs' 'Because they are the seekers of triumphs, they will definitely triumph over you, you better do not go there and get defeated'\nruupa sampannau; ruupyate anena; asaadhaaraNa niratishaya ruupa visheSatvaat 'with an unimaginable stance' They are known for their stance from their childhood in eliminating Tataka, Subaahu etc., gatvaa saumitri sahito naa vijitya ivartate 'on going with Lakshmana, he [Rama] does not return without conquering' yashasaH ca eka bhaajanam : Tara in Kishkindha, 14-20. 'for glory [Rama is] the only resort.' 'So many praises are said about them and hence they fight you out, better do not go'\nIf Khara asks, 'how can they fight me, such a mighty one?'\nFor this she says, sukumaarau 'they are dextrous' 'with their dexterity they easily eliminate you'\nmahaa balau 'greatly mighty' 'Rama is mightily by his shoulder-strength' and also by the use of mahat shabda his might is by his tenacity of mind and ideation to eliminate foes. Or mahaa balau 'greatly sturdy.' Though he wars for a long his vigour does not deplete for he uses two vidya-s: bala, atibala 'by the twin principles taught by Vishvamitra his strength does not deplete.\npuNDariika vishaala akshau 'white-lotus, broad, eyed' His broad white-lotus like eyes does neither contract in anger nor expand in exclamation, as usually happen to anyone who sees an object of interest with unnecessary widening of eyes priiti visphaarita iikshaNam\nNext if it be asked 'are they ready for a fight' for which she says 'they are already clad in ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau 'jute-cloth, deerskin, clad in' They have tightened their girdle-cloths and are armoured in shield like deerskin.

Secondly, whenever Seetha is present we see no killings or slayings in Ramayana, because she, as Goddess Lakshmi, condones any sinner and accords salvation. As such, there may be a probability of not only hindering war, but there may be her blessing to every demon with a free passage to heaven, of which Rama becomes a helpless onlooker. 2] Second reason is that this Lakshmana is intolerant of any assault on his brother or sister-in-law and colloids head-on with the aggressors, which may lead Lakshmana up to Lanka to confront even Ravana. That being the snakily aggressive nature of Lakshmana, Rama bids him to go away before any happening, or any further dialogue is given to Lakshmana. 3] Third is that Rama is the first one to promise the sages and saints to eradicate demons for himself, for which Seetha nags him not to wage a causeless war. Therefore, if Rama is going to hide in any cave camouflaged by trees along with Seetha, and Lakshmana goes on warring, the very character of Rama is at stake. Thus, as promised to sages and saints Rama alone wanted to trigger off the elimination process of demons. That is why Rama breathes fresh air saying \"good riddance\" in next verse.\n"

In the text, its reference has come more often and at the end it is said to have burnt down the vegetation along its course of travel, which indicates that it has some radiation power. Without making it to touch the ground, Rama has splintered it in sky itself, and its destruction is metaphoric with a venomous serpent, and hymns and herbs can bring down that serpent. That is to say even if venomous missiles are used their antidotes are ready at hand.

So also, many epithets used in this epic have relevance to the circumstances, characters, or their actions. These cannot be explained without the support of commentaries, and unfortunately commentaries skip these minor details assuming that the readers are capable enough to grasp them in the course of narration, which resulted otherwise at a later time. We therefore request pundits to consolidate the relevancy of each the inordinate epithet used to the situations narrated somewhere like web, if it is going to cost a fortune on printing and stationary.

Dharmaakuutam clarifies this as: vasca shatru vadhe kaamayamaana raamsya dhanuShi baaNa sandhaana aadi saukaryaartham apasarpaNam raameNa kR^itam bhuuShaNam eva na tu duuShaNam | ata eva muule apasarpaNe kR^ita astram eva hetumatvena maharShiNaa upanyastham | anantara shlokena khara vadaaya shara sandhaana mokShaNa aadi pratipaadanam upapannam bhavati | bhityaa apasarpaNe punaH shara mokSha anupapatto riti | dk 'Wishing to eliminate the demon Rama has taken a back step.

            "comment": "Any wife on seeing her husband returning from a risky journey will embrace her husband delightfully, and nothing special about it. But the commentators attach a great significance to this situation.\nFirstly Seetha is hR^iSTaa 'exultant...' more than happiness. Rama's victory is the cause for that. sati dharmiNi dharmaaH 'nature will have its own peculiar property...' Rama's victory is the peculiar property dharmi, and the exultancy caused is its nature dharma. hR^iSTaa 'exulted' 'thrilling, hair-raising, electrifying' 'as though the inner joy is going to outburst trough the skin pores...' Such is the joy of Seetha.\nThe cause for the extreme exultancy is said next. Vaidehi, is the daughter of Videha King, Janaka and when she is said so, it is remembered that mithila adhipatiH viiraH 'Mithila's king is the bravest of the brave...' Thus, she is aware what bravery and victory are, and knowing that she hailed her victorious husband, for she is a worthy princess. bhartaaram pariSvaje 'husband, embraced...' Is Rama a husband of Seetha or to total Universe? loka bhartaaram suSuveya. He is the husband of the total Universe. When she is the mother of all beings in the universe, and when her husband protects her progeny from the evildoers, will she not embrace that husband of hers, as well as of the Universe? The word bharta 'one who bears...' and this Rama has no other burden to bear, except the Universe.\nThis embracing is pariSvaje, pari sa svaje 'wholly embraced.' She embraced him from all over and fomented his war-wounds with her warm breasts. Then, why for this much happy hugging? It is replied: maharSiiNaam sukha aavaham pariSvaje 'one who brought comfort to great-sages, him she embraced...' The great-sages are her children, supplicating her to recommend to the Supreme Being to bestow His grace for their salvation. Since Rama brought some relief by his paternal affection to these children-like sages, she is happy and hugging.\nSeetha came out of a mountain cave and embraced Rama. This suggests that the innate soul sheSi on the advise of a teacher, after leaving the cave-like living being, is released from bondages and embraces the master sheShin. This is the same predicament for her in Sundara Kanda, where the teacher Hanuma advises her to come with him, but she refuses, because her lord alone has to come conquering, as he has done now as far as her confinement is concerned. Here she is put in cave and guarded by Lakshmana, unlike demonesses guarding her in open-air gardens in Lanka. She came out of the cave and is joining her husband. Govindaraja.\nNext, Maheshvara Tiirtha records: tam dR^iSTvaa shatru hantaaram 'at him Rama, on seeing, enemy, eliminator...'in that compound: tam 'at him...' that Rama, which one-Rama assumed himself as fourteen thousand Rama-s, appearing as each to each demon at the time of war, with his divinely gracious aspect divya mangala vigraha and eliminated all demons, that Rama she saw. te tu yaavanta evaa~Nau taavaan tu dadR^ishe sataiH As many demons are there, so many Rama-s are there on the battlefield.\ntam 'at him...' 'who eliminated fourteen thousand demons, single-handedly, , that too in seventy two minutes. These demons are so far undeafted even by Indra with all his forces. Rama defeated such demons without any damage to his person, a + vyayam 'unscathed, undamaged... and very easily also...' at such a Rama Seetha saw.\ntam 'him' who looks girlish. Seetha once said that Rama is girly not only in his looks but also in bravery, perhaps. raama jaamaataram praapya striyam puruSha vigraham Ayodhya Part I, 30-3. When Rama dissuades Seetha from coming to forests, Seetha said to Rama, 'my father is the King of Mithila and he may think that you have left me behind at Ayodhya unable to protect me in forests... thus my father may also think that he got a 'girl' as his son-in-law in you...' Through this is a tongue-in-cheek expression Seetha reminded Rama at that situation of his Mohini ruupa 'getup of Mohini...' which he assumed at the time of churning Milky Ocean, it is her woomanhood that spoke like that. Though not then, even now Rama looks girlishly pleasant, if he is not summoning wrath upon him, as per his attributes, puNDarika vishaala aksha, somavat priya darshanaH 'lotus-petal-eyed, moon-like-delightful-aspect...' And he becomes unsightly, only if angered. Such a girlish Rama has won war, and at him Seetha saw in admiration about his mannishness. Now her father Janaka will definitely appreciate his son-in-law Rama. King Janaka is a result-oriented king, as said in Gita, 3-20: karmaNi evahi samsiddham aasthitaH janakaadayaH 'Janaka and others are involved in self-less- result-oriented deeds...' and facing him without results is impossible. Thus Seetha's opinion is 'my father Janaka who is result-oriented and self-less in his pursuits, he will now appreciate Rama, since Rama has also accomplished a self-less pursuit in saving the sages...'\ntam shatru hantaaram 'at him... who has annihilated the enemies in war...' as he has annihilated troops and troops of unwieldy demons as said at: taiH dhanuu~NShi dhvaja agraaNi carmaaNi ca shiraa~Nsi ca || 3-25-21 and at bahuun sa hasta aabharaNaan uuruun kari kara upamaan | 3-25-22 [A] and also who later said that he will emerge, as and when needed to eradicate vice, as at paritraNaaya saadhuunaam vinaashaaya ca duSkR^itaam - Gita: 4-8 And Seetha saw at such an omnipotent Being who is an eliminator of evil.\nmaharSiNaam sukha aavaham 'for great-sages, accorder of comfort...' dR^iSTvaa vaidehii babhuuva 'on seeing Vaidehi became...' she became one with herself bhuu sattaayaam. When it is said aatmaa vai puruSasya daaraa 'wife indeed is the soul of manl...' that soul of Rama, namely Seetha is so far in a dilemma, because Rama is a lone-warrior against fourteen-thousand demons and his safe return is ambiguous. Now that he remained unhurt, that soul called Seetha, has regained her abode in Rama. Then hR^iSTaa pariSvaje 'delightfully embraced...' Maheshvara Tiirtha.\nDharmaakuutam also derives the same meanings, but with reference to dharma:\nsiitaa -- anaparaadhi raakShasa jana vadho na ucita iti vaidehii kR^ita pratiShedham api - apyaham jiivitam jahyaam tvaam vaa site - iti prakaareNa anaadR^itya - caturdasha sahasraaNi raakShasa -- ekasca raamo -- iti R^iShi janaanaam api samshayite uddhe kruurataraan raakShasaan hatvaa - avyatho yo raamaH taadR^ishaH paraamR^ishyate -- siitaa -- tathaa ca - shatru hantaaram maharShiNaam sukha aavaham -- iti - avyadham iti ca visheShaNaani upapannaani bhavanti -- ata eva ete arthaa uttara slokaabhyaam upasamhR^itaaH\n"

Any employee is a half-slave to his master, artha daasaa janaaH sarve as the money paid makes one a slave of the payer. This spy prompted Ravana in that way because he knows that Ravana is womaniser. Like-king-like-subjects yathaa raajaa tathaa prajaaH thus great-demons think alike. Further Ravana did not ask for the triggering point for the elimination of these many demons. If Ravana questions about it, Akampana had to say that Ravana's own sister Shuurpanakha wanted to debauch. Then Ravana's rage multiplies and he may even kill Akampana.\n2. All the sages, including Agastya, have declared to Rama that they have planned to bring Rama to Janasthaana only to eliminate the demons at Janasthaana and going further from Janasthaana to Lanka and eliminating Ravana is Rama's headache.

We usually find in Ramayana spectacular entrances for cities, characters, and situations. Before such a fantastic entrance of Ravana, for which a full sarga/chapter is allotted, this chapter is said to be a glaring hurdle. In here, this Akampana is glorified as a sagacious person, yet he gives advise to Ravana to abduct Seetha. This advice is said to contain the setting of the ultimate war-field in Lanka. But, the weight of the very same advise by Shuurpanakha is lost to this of a spy. Shuurpanakha's intent is very clear, but the meaning, purpose and the achievement of this spy is very unclear, except to that which is said by commentators.\nRavana on going to Maareecha, and hearing all indirect puraNa-s 'mythologies...' returns to Lanka as a gentleman. If he were to be this gentle, Ramayana would not be there. But Maheshvara Tiirtha, the commentator says: ata eva raavaNasya siitaa raama bhR^ityatvena taa uddisya tena vakShyamaaNaani baahya dR^iShTyaa durbhaaShaNa vat pratiiyamaanaani api vaakyaani - - vastutaH stuti paraaNi eva  'Though the utterances of Ravana apparently mean as vile, but their subtext is that of a devotee of Vishnu. -- Maheshvara Tiirtha\nIf Ravana is a true devotee, basing on many mythologies and sub-mythologies, the way in which he treated Seetha in Lanka is evident and it pictures him as a clear-cut villain. Thus says another commentator, namely Rama Tilaka, whose aim is to elicit literary values of Ramayana, and who dismisses all this hyperboling. Whether this chapter is interpolated or original, this is included in traditional versions, and hence it is to be sincerely incorporated here, because commentators have said a lot about it. So goes the tradition.\n",

            "comment": "This 'secretly going to his own garage...' is one among the many oddities of Ravana that is suggested here. Kings never go to stables or garages but horses or chariots come to their fore, if ordered. Ravana's ministers have heard Shuurpanakha's report about the destruction of all the demons in Janasthaana. Because they have heard, it will not remain a secret or suppressible fact, but it will spread as a wild fire. Then some action has become necessary for Ravana now to save his face. praaNam eva parityajya maanam eva abhirakshatu 'Let life go but not the self-respect...' So, his first thinking is to wage a war with Rama, but it may become a worthless expedition because Rama's capabilities are partially known. Next, he thought to abduct Seetha, for she is said not only to be beautiful but a dearly cherished wife of Rama. If Seetha is distracted from Rama, Rama may die anguishing for Seetha, thus this imminent danger, called Rama, gets ruined once for all.\nThe human nature is bhaaryaa duHkham punar bhaaryaa just 'to lament for a parted wife for some time till a second wife is secured...' Thus, that wife-addict Rama will lament for Seetha for some time and seeks another woman as his wife. Instead, if he starts searching for Seetha alone, it is impossible for those two young humans to come searching this far, or to cross the ocean, or to enter Lanka. And even on entering Lanka, it is impossible to survive further at the hands of demons. These are some of the many of his deliberations on the 'strengths and weaknesses and the credits and discredits...' of his thought mentioned in the verse.\nThen he enters his beautiful vehicle garage secretly. Why a king shall behave this quirkily? Because 'walls have ears...' and what all Shuurpanakha barked in the court must be audible throughout the palace by now, or may be all over Lanka, and if someone sees Ravana's exit at this point of time, everyone despises him, on the charge that he is trying to bring yet another woman. Though it is not said vividly here, that he is going to abduct Seetha thievishly keeping his valour and bravery aside, this will be made known in the words of Kumbhakarna in Yuddha Kaanda. This is shameful for his own self, as he did not do this way on previous occasions. For such a cowardly act, even Ravana's cherished wife Mandodari may despise or deride Ravana. So, he came to stables with a quirk of secrecy, which of course, will not remain a secret, soon.\n"

            "comment": "This statement contains 'why you have come again?' and taking hold of this word, 'again...' some, who hold that the episode of Akampana is justifiable, say that the episode of Akampana is not interpolated but the original work of Valmiki. For this, the ex-party says that when a whole of chapter is included, inclusion of one word 'again...' is not a bothersome affair to the mythologists or interpolators. When it is questioned that interspersing Akampana's episode defeats the spectacular entry of Ravana, the defendants say that the antagonists need not be given such priorities. So also, Vali's Kishkindha is not portrayed in a spectacular way when Sugreeva attacked Vali for the first time, but it is detailed in the second round, to some extent, and fully when Lakshmana enters it.\nIn this episode, a jump of event to Garuda's exploits may be jerky, but it is questioned when can Ravana recollect about Garuda's might, why does he ignore still mightier Vishnu. Ravana's continuous fear for Vishnu made him to think of Garuda - that too, on seeing Subhadra, the banyan tree, and that too - while going to kidnap Seetha.\nThe path through which Ravana coursed is towards Himalayas, where an idolatry place called deva bhuumi is said to be earmarked for higher souls. When Rama hit Maareecha, he fell far off from the ritual place of Vishwamitra. That place is said to be on northern side of Himalayas. Some ancient mms contain this verse which also tell about that place as deva bhuumi and it is on the northern side of kuru i.e., kurukhsetra where Great War of Maha Bharata occurred: uttar˜nþca kur¨n paþyan paþyan caiva nagottam˜n | deva d˜nava sanghai× ca sevitam hi am®ta arthibhi× ||\n"

This suggests that he is not wearing any shield or armour to keep him safe. In Bala Kanda, at the outset of the journey of Rama and Lakshmana with Vishvamitra, it is said that they are wearing finger-covers made of certain lizard skin, which means to say that their fingers are very tender in using arrows. His mothers delicately arranged the locks of hair, because he is still 'boyish' to her. More so, he is with a 'boyish' ornament, say a single pendant, not verily embellished with princely jewellery. He appeared like some providential 'boy' hitherto unseen, with the height of a peacock, with the complexion of peacock-neck-blue, and moving about like a noble peacock. This boyish-Rama peacock is not screaming, yet his bow is twanging; leave alone the screeching and screaming.\nThe 'new-moon' metaphor to Rama suggests that he has only waxing and no waning in him, uttarottara abhivR^iddhi and also that he is by birth an antagonist of tamas 'the darkness,' or darkish activities, like the moon whose activity is only to illumine the night. Further, he has a likeable persona to any, even to the present demon Maareecha, and even to Ravana. When Ravana sees Rama for the first time in war, Ravana praisefully acknowledges Rama's personality.

Neither Rama, nor any ordinary husband can say so. Then this predictive sentence becomes self-contrary. Contrariwise, taking some concessions of grammar, because most of Ramayana is un-Paninian, Rama is indirectly hinting Lakshmana that something is immanent, because 'after the elimination of demons like Khara, Duushana nothing drastic has happened, but a queer deer has come, and thus something may now happen.' Then, if this asyaam is given to kartavyam 'the enterprise' as tasmin then the connection is: asmaakam yat kR^ityam asyaam [tasmin] aayattam asaama 'for us, which, enterprise is there, in that, circumspect, we shall be' 'Which enterprise is there for us individually, in that we both shall conduct separately and circumspectly, and you do your job of guarding Seetha and I mine in bringing the deer or its skin, duly eliminating that conjuring demon.' In such a case, the blemish soothsaying or prophesising will not occur to Rama, in saying 'Seetha as the pivotal character is to be kidnapped by Ravana' etc. In fact, Rama is the person who is more beguiled by the deer.\n"

            "comment": "Poor Seetha, she could not romanticise the Golden Deer better than Rama. Then it may be asked 'what is the necessity for Rama to romanticise and compare it to the skyey star-deer and others. Is it for the deer or for the deerskin?' This is the unanswered question. 'It is for the deer alone but not its skin,' said so in reply by some. If it were to be for the deerskin, from the view point of Rama, he could have shot his arrow from where he is standing, which arrow miraculously pierces any terrain, kills the deer, and safely comes back into his quiver, as in the case of showing his prowess to Sugreeva. Otherwise, Rama should have turned down the request of Seetha, as he did in the ninth chapter of this Aranya Kanda, when she was saying: 'where that weapon? Where this forest? Where the principles of Kshatriya? And where is the sageness? All this is inconsistent... By us, let the laws of the land be esteemed...' as at 3-9-27. When kings come into such a sort of allurement, many wise men quote this instance of Rama's going after the deer as a reminder to them, as in Maha Bharata.\n\"Impossible is the birth of a Golden Deer, even then Rama is lured, if time is perilous, even the best man's brain deranges.'\nFate harasses the faculty, faculty cannot harass the fate, even the cleverest Rama, went after the Golden Deer.\nUnborn it was, none has seen yet, nor mentioned about it, such is the mirage of Rama. Parlous time causes perilous percipience.\nHence Rama's going after the deer is for the deerskin, on one count, and for the deer itself, on the other as affirmed by Lakshmana because Lakshmana never says untruth. This Maareecha is recurrently falling after Rama. Once an accident, twice a coincidence, but thrice... a habituation... and it become habitual for Maareecha to dare Rama. Hence, Rama has to do something to Maareecha, permanently.\nThe other view according to puranic/mythological sayings is that god endows whatever you seek. But that god alone says: 'Seek you will get it, but seek not by the extrinsic values of objects.' This saying has it counterpart at: 'Every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth.' St Matthew, p[Ch. 7, v. 8] The Bible. But 'seek something within the nature, according to your nature... but not the supernatural... for eyes belie the nature of objects...' is the essence here. He/she who seeks beyond means will have to suffer, either by getting it or devoid of it. This is said in innuendo at 3-43-33, that 'the results of pipedreams fill the coffers of Shukra.'\nFurther, because parlous time has come to Rama and Seetha, epically, providentially, and episodically, Rama has to move away from Seetha. While going after the deer, Rama says much to Lakshmana about the security to Seetha and also informs him that 'she is pivotal to our mission.' He did not say these many farewells when sending Seetha and Lakshmana for hiding in a cave at the time of elimination Khara, Duushana, and the other fourteen thousand demons. At one time Rama spared Maareecha's life in the forest of Tataka while guarding Vishwamitra's ritual, only to cause Maareecha to come now. As such, Rama has to go after Maareecha. Besides, Seetha or Goddess Lakshmi will let none killed in her presence.\n",

Bringing the folded palms up to one's own heart is suggestive of 'pouring forth one's own heart' at the other, which is known in prayers as iungo manus ante pectus and if it is lifted up to forehead, it is suggestive of 'concentrating with whole of the mind,' and if hands are totally lifted into air it is for the god unknown. But here this iungere manus is neither ante pectus, infra pectus, nor supra abdomen but a quick gesture. He is performing an iSTa namaskaara 'un, interested, greeting...' 'a half-hearted gesture' like a 'cold-handshake' rather than a 'warm' one because he is now sent by her compulsively and compulsorily.\nIndian woman is no sacred cow. For that matter, no woman is of that kind, unless compulsorily conditioned to be like that. A woman can be said as cow-faced-tigress, as: go mukha vyaaghra, [not in dissent.] She prowls, growls and howls at others if her interests are contradicted. Thus, Seetha's is not only a sacred cow but also a shrewd lioness-princess, and her rash talking is not new or instantaneous at this place alone. She said something against Kaikeyi with Sumantra, which, Sumantra does not report to Kausalya in Ayodhya Kanda, chapter 60, and verse 14. One full chapter, Aranya Kanda of 9th is catered to Seetha's haranguing Rama, when Rama wanted to wage an unprovoked war. She does not spare even her own husband, if the contemplated deed is contrary to her thinking, and because she is countering her own husband she includes a saving clause, 'I have spoken in all my womanliness... it is up to you to decide....' otherwise it will be a straight tongue-lashing. Thus talking riff-raff with Lakshmana is no great surprise.\nFurther, she is angering through perplexity caused by the hearing a help cry similar in tone with her husband's voice: bhartR^i aarta svara sadR^isham aakrandanam aakraNya vidiirNa hR^idayaa hR^idaya dayitu premNaa kartavyam ajaananaa jaanakii - - - sam utpanna kopayaa siitayaa - bhaaShitam - dk Seetha said mama hetoH praticchannaH 'for me you are covertly behaving...' and Lakshmana, who is famous for his rashness also said to Seetha tiikShNaa bhedakaraaH striyaH 'women are the severe wreckers...' of households, kingdoms etc., remembering Sage Agastya's saying in Aranya, Ch. 13 verse 6: 'With the dangling of hundreds of streaks of thunderbolt and also a weapon's incisiveness, and also with the speediness of an eagle and wind's gust, the women are conformable...'\nBesides, Seetha vowed to offer many oblations to Ganga, when crossing that river to enter the deep of forests in Ayodhya II, Ch. 52, verses 87-90: suraa ghaTa sahasreNa maamsa bhuuta odanena ca yakShyaami aham 'I will offer thousand pots of liquor, meaty food, if, my husband and I return safely...' Even though Shiromani Vyaakhya says that these are not liquor pots or it is not the meat food, yet they are some offerings to be made by Seetha to Ganga, if they return. She uses many 'if' clauses while praying thus, for the safety of her husband. What will become of them, if Rama's life itself is at stake?\nHere, both Seetha and Lakshmana, are accusing each other. It is not reiterated elsewhere in Ramayana, and hence some say that this episode is an interpolation. 'Can these two go on narrating this scandalous dialogue to somebody, detailing how each accused the other...' is the ensuing question. This episode has happened in between these two and it does not merit a discussion with somebody else, because such a discussion will attract many cha, cha-s, and chi, chi--s for Seetha, hence this is neither an interpolation nor a repeatable episode.\nThen the commentator concludes in saying that each of them is right in his/her way and in emotion, situation and portent. siitaa vacanasya bharti aarta shabda shravaNa samjaata kheda vashena aapadi raamo avashyam samrakShaNiiya iti etat abhipraayakatvaat | lakShmaNa vacanam api ayukta tara siitaa vacana shravaNa janita kopa vashena pravR^ittam | agastya vacanam tu svataH saralaa siitaa iti abhipraayakam iti na virodhaH - - dk\nLater, Seetha repents for her rash talk with Lakshmana in yuddha kaaNDa, Ch. 113, verses 40, 45-46, saying:\n'When my fate is against me, and when my earlier sins [of finding fault with Lakshmana,] have acquired this [incarceration in Lanka...] one has to reap the results of one's own faults... a sinner, or a do-gooder, or one undergoing a capital punishment shall be treated kindly... who is he/she that does not offend...'\nThese are the very same words of Sugreeva in Kishkindha, Ch. 36, verse 11: \"Either in faith or in friendliness if I have overstepped, in the least, that may be pardoned for I am an attendant of yours... for, none is unoffending...' All this culminates into the saying 'to err is human...'\nOn the other hand, in the perspective of mythology, the time has come for Seetha to go to Lanka, in order to effectuate her curse to Ravana as Vedavati, where Vedavati cursed Ravana, 'I will be the root cause for your total elimination... as Seetha...' For such a transit, Rama shall go away from her, for that she wanted that golden deer and as a good husband Rama ran after it. But this security guard is an obstinate obstacle than Rama and he will not go away from here, because he has to keep custody of his brother's entrustment. Unless such unbearable words are spoken to a self-respectful person like Lakshmana, he doe not stir out. To stop his leeching onto her, she had to talk in an abnormal way, which made him to go away, though reluctantly, and which paved the way for Ravana's entry. If the Golden Deer is not there, Rama will not go, if Rama's voice is not heard Lakshmana cannot be sent, and if Lakshmana does not go, Ravana will not come... then a blemish called anavasthaa doSha -- ad infintum...occurs to Ramayana. If we do not mind to end Ramayana in that way, Ravana will be ruling high, even today...\n",

Hence she is said here as Maithili because she hails from Mithila and her father's court was full with these sanyasi-s, yati-s, parivraajaka-s. Then it is questioned as to why she invited him, though recognised him as a pseudo-Brahman. For this Govindaraja says: kaaSaaya daNDa maatreNa yatiH puujyo na samshayaH | 'By spotting the saffron robe alone, a sanyasi is venerable...'\nThen, another doubt is raised as to how she noticed him to be pseudo- sanyasi . For this it is said raatri advaanam yaanam ca strii kathaa laulyam eva ca | mancakam shukla vastram yatiinaam patanaani SaT || 'Meandering during night, using vehicles, showing interest in episodes relating to women, and relations with women, using a cot to sleep, wearing white cloths... these six show the downfall of his sanyaasi-hood...' Ravana is indulged in strii kathaa in the whole of this chapter, in admiring at her lips, breasts, thighs etc., and no usual swasti vacana, shubha aashiis 'blessings...' are uttered by him and thus Seetha could discern him to be a pseudo- sanyasi.\nThough knowing him as such, why should she revere him at all, is another question. What else she could do as his appearance itself is uddveSTum a+shakyam 'irrefutable appearance of a Brahman sanyasi...' hence, somehow some time is to be gained until the arrival of Rama or Lakshmana. Otherwise, this pseudo-sanyasi may cause any pseudo-problem that she cannot solve. For this, the reply is at the word in the last verse haritam dadarsha... 'only greenery is seen by her not Rama nor Lakshmana...' And in the next verse itself she is addressing him as a \"Brahman...' but not with the titles like sanyasi or yatiishvara, paramahamsa, parivraajaka etc. A Brahman alone is eligible to take up sanyaasa 'Hindu-sanyaasi-hood...' not Kshatriya or others. Hence, she concluded him to be Brahman. When once the sanyaasi-hood is taken he is no more a Brahman and his bodily being neutralises in the Absolute, and such a sanyaasi shall drag on his body, without comfortable bodily needs, until his natural death.

Thus 'my ambidextrous husband's eyes are broad puNDariika vishaala akshaH, and those eyes are a couple of fish-eye lenses of a camera and can view in 360º, thus you cannot escape their target, in any angle...' Further, these and some more attributes in the coming verses like simha uraska etc., they are the very same words coined by Sage Narada, while informing Valmiki about Rama in the first chapter of Bala Kanda. Some think such repetitions are essentially Homeric.

No doubt, Seetha is a nagging, quarrelling, and sermonising, tongue-lashing woman but if it comes to her husband, she is undone without him, though he lost his empire, roaming in forests, eating trash etc., and yet she does not depart from her pledge to the institution of marriage.\nRead more about: rama and verse\nSecure FTPS on the planet FREE Go FTP Software\n",

            "comment": "Nobility will not seek help selfishly; if help is sought that way, the seeker instantly becomes an ignoble, falling from the heights of personal nobility. Seetha may be an impetuous lady but if she talking to a noble elderly person or being, she talks judiciously in all her humbleness. Here she is not asking Jatayu to wage a war against Ravana to save her. She is asking Jatayu to convey the news of her abduction to Rama, because as an old eagle, as old as her father-in-law, Jatayu may not fight back this Ravana successfully. Besides, Ravana is with weaponry and a cunning warrior. Jatayu may be a powerful eagle, but if it comes to weapons and missiles, a natural being cannot withstand the artificial ammunition of war. Hence, visualising the danger in Jatayu's attempting any combat with Ravana, she is asking him to be the carrier of news, as all the trees, river and her birds, sylvan deities, and the other birds and animals are not heedful of her request, and this eagle alone is beheld, besides being an old acquaintance.\nWhether Seetha is touched by Ravana or not - is a much debated issue by ancient commentators. When Ravana is carrying a curse on his head, that makes his head/heads to be splintered, if he lustfully touches any woman, against her will, it is questioned how his head is not splintered now, when touching Seetha. Maheshvara Tiirtha brings in skaanda puraaNa which says that: chaayaa graahitvam api asi sarva vidyaa vishaarade | kesha chaayaam paraamR^ishya jaanu chaayam tahaiva ca | gR^ihiitvaa jaanakiim hR^iShTo lankaam praayaa tathaa eva ca | 'Ravana being an expert in all branches of sciences, caught Janaki by the shadow of her head-hair and the shadow of thighs...' Maheshvara Tiirtha.\nFor this Rama Tilaka says yet another way of catching Seetha, as explained for the verse at 3-49-17: muurdhajeSu kareNa : muudhaja iSu kareNa 'best ones, arrows, with hands...' 'with the hands that handle the best arrows... Seetha is caught...' vaama kareNa uurvo saH pari jagraaha here the word uuru which usually translates as 'thighs' is said as 'feet...' 'Ravana caught hold of her feet as the Planet Budha, the Jupiter caught the feet of his mother Star Rohini in early times; and now iks requesting his personal deity Goddess Lakshmi to come to Lanka. Rama Tilaka.\nCatching Seetha while she is standing is not possible in both the ways as said above. She should be in a supine position on ground to handle her from under her thighs or at the nape of the neck. Her falling on ground is not explicitly said in these verses in Aranya. But Seetha says at verse 3-49-34, that 'in a state of helplessness, I am abducted...' This word vivasha, vi vashatvam is not only 'helplessness...' but also a state of 'swooning...' She repeats the same wording in Sundara Kanda and even in Yuddha Kanda II at verse 8 of 116 sarga, while replying Rama's accusation, in saying that yadi aham gaatra samsparsham gataa asmi vivashaa prabho 'when I was 'helpless' I was touched by Ravana... fault is not mine, gods alone have fouled it...' Thus, it is assumed that Seetha was in a short swoon when caught by Ravana. Then again, when she was rolling on ground in the same state Ravana lifts her up by her waist into his air-chariot.\nAll this discussion is to establish Seetha is an 'untouchable' for others, and for fear of a blemish to her paativratya 'husband-devotness...' which topic will be raised by no other than Rama, after war. The absolute devotees of Rama or Seetha hold Ravana's touching Seetha, as an intolerable act. Thus, to portray that Seetha is 'untouchable' there are many more legends woven around this topic.\nOne among it is lakshmaNa rekha 'Lakshmana's drawing a line around the hermitage, like a firewall...' When Seetha transgressed this firewall and came out of it to offer alms to Ravana, in Brahman sanyaasi's guise, she in her fear fell down on ground, as said in aadhyaatma raamaayaNa in the verse: tato vidaarya dharaNiim nakhaiH uddhR^itya baahubhiH | tolayitvaa rathe kShiptaa yayau kShipram vihaayasaa || 'then [Ravana] cleaved the earth with his nails, uplifting that clod with his hands and with a balancing act put it in the air-chariot, and quickly went away in skyway...'\nAnother anthology says that Rama while going after the Golden Deer, hid the real Seetha and placed a maayaa siitaa ' an illusory Seetha...' in the cottage. This deceptive Seetha is continued until her self-immolation after Great War. Real Seetha emerged out of the pyre instead of this Maya Seetha. Then it is questioned, whether the bemoaning and bewailing of Rama for Seetha, throughout the later part of the epic is to hoodwink the readers or so? It is then replied that this also is one among the many miraculous effects of Vishnu viSNu maaya All this culminates into the saying of Bhagavad Gita: vyavasaayaatmikaa buddhiH eka iha kuru nandana | bahu shakhaa hi anantaah ca buddhayo avyavasaayiNaam || 2-41 'the object to determine is distinct singularly, and many and unending are those who say manifoldly with indistinct minds....'\nNothing happens by mere touching of Seetha, for she is a resolute lady to abide by her husband Rama. Valmiki is very clear in picturing her to be a stubborn and staunch husband-devote, and no more mythological bends are required to prove her chastity. She herself proved this with her agni pravesha ' self-immolation...' to all concerned. If Seetha acquired a blemish by mere touch, then Draupadi will be in a more pathetic state, since she is physically handled by Keecaka, that too when she is in her senses. The common feature in both the cases is, some other man 'touching their braids...' A woman's head hair cannot be touched by anybody in molestation. atra dashagriivo atyanta avamati ruupam kula kShaya karam kesha grahaNam svasya bhavitavya anuruupatayaa kR^itavaa | kesha grahaNasya - sabhaa nayana - paruSha bhaaShaNa - vastra apaharaNa - aadi apekShayaa - vadhopekShayaa ca atyanta avamati karatvam kula kShaya karatva ca bhaarate prati paaditam - dk 'Ravana is predestined for self-ruin, hence touched the braid of Seetha, and touching the braid of a lady, dragging her to king's court, roughly talking to her, undressing her, all these lead to the destruction of one's own clan, as demonstrated in Maha Bharata...' In vana parva of mahA bhaarata, when Draupadi goes on complaining that 'I am dragged by my braid... I am dragged by my braid...' Krishna says to Draupadi: rudiShyanti striyo hi evam yeShaam kruddhaa asi bhaamini | satyam te pratijaanaaami raaj~naa raaj~nii bhaviShyasi || 'you women always go on weeping for such tings... [having suffered in such a way,] I promise that you alone will become the empress...' So also, Seetha is instrumental for the elimination of evil, called Ravana together with all his clansmen. This is as pledged by Veadavati, an earlier incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi. As such, Seetha has to go to Lanka to attend that complete eradication, according to mythology.\nWhether it is myth or real she is not all a frailty to yield up that easily nor a weak bodied one for an easy molestation. She travelled the length and breadth of the country barefooted, that too in impenetrable forests. These ladies of lore had their yogic faculties with which Gaandhaari, the mother Duryodhana, in Maha Bharata makes him a diamond-bodied one, excepting his thighs. Their words come true if they utter them with certain concentration. At the time of burning the tail of Hanuma in Sundara Kaanda Seetha says: siito bhava 'cool down...' 'Let the fire on the tail of that monkey be coolant to him...' and it happened accordingly. That burning tail burnt whole Lanka, except some places, without any scorching effect on Hanuma. Likewise she would have said at Ravana hato bhava 'dead, you are...' but she does not say so. Rama's pledge to saints and sages to eliminate evil on earth is to be fulfilled by Rama alone.\nLeaving the untouchablness or otherwise of Seetha aside, since every negative act is to be solemnised, let us listen to the fruits of listening or reading of this episode, siitaa apaharaNa 'abduction of Seetha...' as it involves the elimination of evil on earth, Skanda Puraana says 'nothing inauspicious will happen to those best people who listen this episode of Seetha's abduction...'\n",

'Because it is bird, it may be handled...' is one adjustment, while the other is, 'when Jataayu is a personified entity and a friend of Dasharatha, this bird is as good as a man. So, Seetha's touching him shall be a taboo...' The commentators deal this aspect in the next chapter of this canto.\nThe character of Jataayu is not introduced just to give information to Rama at the time of his physical death. He is an example of self-duteous, self-dedicated, unpaid servant to his master. In Ch.14 of this Aranya canto when Jataayu firstly met Rama he says: so aham vaasa sahaayaH te bhaviShyaami yadi icChasi | idam durgam hi kaantaaram mR^iga raakShasa sevitam siitaam ca taata rakShiShye tvayi yaate salakShmaNe ||\"That is what I am, I will be your helpmate at your residence, should you wish so, for this forest is one that is impassable and adorned by predators and demons...oh boy, I wish to protect Seetha, if you go out of your residence with Lakshmana...\" 3-14-34 And Jataayu kept up his pledge in 'helping Rama and protecting Seetha' as much as he can, without hesitation. This selfless service and sermons he rendered to Ravana are exemplary. This is called daasya bhakti 'devoutness through selfless service...' and service whether paid or unpaid is thus to be rendered selflessly - is the lesson he taught.\nSecondly, birds hitting airplanes is not a recent phenomenon and it existed even before airplanes were invented, as is evident from Jataayu's hitting Ravana's aircraft. And Ravana's aircraft that is variously and amazingly portrayed by the sage-poet, is nothing before a bird. Hence, Ravana should have used some other latest state of art technology to prevent such bird-hits. This is to say, any artificial paraphernalia is nothing before a living organism, and Hanuma, a mere monkey, taking lessons from Jataayu, a mere eagle, reduces even the artificially devised Lanka to ashes.\n",

Some publications of this Gorakhpur version has this word samgR^ihya a word of less intensity, 'taken into hands...' has a replacement parishvajya, aali.ngya the words with clear-cut action, 'embraced, hugged a dying eagle with a fatherly affection. Therefore it does not mean women are 'untouchables' in general.\nFrom Ravana's side his curse is that, 'his head splinters into thousands of pieces if he touches other's woman...' But it is not yet splintered though he handled Seetha that roughly. Hence, that curse in its actuality is 'raping' but not mere 'touching' of body parts. Touching the 'untouchable' parts of other's women, that too without proper and full consent of that woman. As such, though he touched Seetha, carried on his flanks, took to his Lanka on his own body, he gives her time to reconcile herself, but does not make haphazard advances unilaterally.

A very big controversy surrounds this statement and whole of the auxiliary Ramayana-s are brought in, along with puraaNa-s, which substantiate this riddler, maayaa siita.\nAs it is, we do not find that much debatable aspect in Valmiki Ramayana, if the statement that 'Ravana placed Seetha in an unapproachable Black Hole like Lanka, as Maya once placed Hema in an unapproachable underground Black Hole...' is taken up. This episode of demon Maya-Hema occurs in Kishkindha, Ch. 51, which may please be referred. Then it suffices to satisfy the verbiage of aasuriim, when the analogy of 1] Lanka of Ravana and R^iksha bila, 'Black Hole' of Maya, both being the constructions of artifice, and again between 2] Maya, the demon and Ravana, the demon, [that too, the eliminable demons,] 3] nymphet Hema and nymphal Seetha, [the causative factors for elimination,] and the actual eliminators Indra and Rama, is taken into consideration.\nThe eyes of Seetha are said to be blackish at their ends. This is not mascara or something like a makeup article. The eyelashes are longish like those of celestials, so as to give a blackish orb around her eyeball and because she is now ceaselessly shedding tears, these eyelashes are tear-wet and slanted edge-ward to give a blackish shade at the end of her eyes.\n"

'he believed in his own self that he achieved a great feat, as his brain gone astray foolishly...' But the poet also says proximately that he is amused in gaining an archenemy's animosity, i.e. that of Rama. It is therefore said that he is happy as his release from his accursed demon-hood is set to happen soon, as he achieved the abduction of Seetha, thus paved way for Rama to come to Lanka to release him from his accursed being. This is supported by the statement in verse that Ravana's words have some mahaa artham 'words with allusion, or secret message' to Rama perhaps, as at verse 29.\nIf Lanka is a body, it embodies pleasure seeking traits seated in manas 'pleasuring heart...' along with an 'ever witnessing soul...' called saakshi buuta aatma. Along with the release of captivated soul, called Seetha, this pleasure seeking manas 'heart' also gets released. And the releaser or the deliverer is Rama, and hence Ravana is happy.\n",

It is said that yet another ancient mms of Ramayana contains the same verse as: alam vriiDena vaidehi dharma taapa kR^itena ca | harSho ayam devi vispaShTo yaH tvaam upagamiShyati || where the first foot is almost the same and the second foot: harSo ayam devi vispaSTo yaH tvaam upagamiSyati which means devi oh, lady yaH harSaH which pleasure you are going to get with your queen-hood tvaam upagamiSyati to you approaching in the mode of queen-hood ayam harSaH vispaSTaH that pleasure is evident...\n'Oh, Lady, which pleasure you are going to get as a queen, for that queen-hood is fast approaching you, that pleasure is evident... why then you presume that marrying me is anti-canonical, and thus be ashamed...' so said Ravana with a kind of epicurean philosophy.\nA woman who marries twice is called punarbhuH and these are of three kinds. And then there is another type called svairiNi. The first category are the women who leave off their first husbands and get married to another, thus become the first punarbhuH and the svairiNi is the kind of women who will not care customs but follow their own course of alliances. para puurvaaH striyaH tvat anyaaH sapta proktaa svayambhuvaa | punarbhuuH trividhaa taasaam tu svairiNii catur vidhaa || naarada Then Ravana is supposed to have argued with Seetha 'you become a punarbhuH or choose whatever kind of scriptural statement about the rules of remarriages, but marry me - Govindaraja.\nThere is another kind of Indian marriage called raakshasa vivaaha loosely: 'demonical marriage...' i.e., abducting a girl with her consent and marrying secretly. But this way of raakshasa vivaaha 'marriage through abduction...' is admissible only to unmarried girls but not to the married women. Hence, the scriptural canons again cannot be satisfied. Therefore Ravana is said to have stated all this as an eyewash due to his tamo guNa praadhaanyata 'stupid contrivance of scripture with his stolidity of mind...' Maheshvara Tirtha\n'If Ravana is stupid enough to distort scriptures how then can his - devotee-goddess relation - with Seetha can be established...' is the question of Rama Tilaka. Thus, it is concluded that Ravana's advances are only with a lecherous intent, contrary to what Maheshvara Tiirtha tried to establish Ravana as a devotee... Tilaka.\nIn spite of all these debates and counter-debates of commentators - Ravana remained as a devotee of Seetha, namely Goddess Lakshmi, legendarily.\n",

Anyway she treated Ravana just as a worthless straw - is another viewpoint.

When this boldness is there why she is emaciated through sadness - is the collateral question. For this, it is said that her wailing is not for herself, but for her separation from Rama, coupled with her thinking about Rama's miseries in forest, besides, due to the ambiguity about Lakshmana's meeting with Rama or otherwise.\nTilaka says, 'Seetha is aware of the curse of Ravana that his heads get splintered into pieces if he makes advances to any female without her consent, hence Seetha is talking fearlessly. And if Ravana tries to make any further advances, Seetha is ready to disappear, as is the practice with gods, or to become an untouchable entity, like a hologram...' But this is negated, taking Seetha as a human level entity rather than an incarnation, saying that 'human Seetha is unaware of Ravana himself, thus her becoming aware of his curse is untenable...' Maybe, Goddess Lakshmi or Maya Seetha is aware of that curse of Ravana.\n"

Though this is amplified elsewhere it is reiterated here also. The nomenclature of caNDaal is not the present day 'untouchable' 'outcaste' or a 'pariah' etc., because he is also a member and an important functionary in Hindu system of castes. The analogy is between the Vedic-scholar and profaner, [meaning: one who is not initiated into religious rites or any esoteric knowledge...] and between the Altar of Fire and Fire of Pyre, and between the Vedic Ritual and Funeral Rites, both involving Vedic-hymns. A Vedic scholar may perhaps conduct a yaj~na but he is no authority to conduct antya kriya 'funerals' till its end. At best, a priest's function is until the lighting of the pyre, and even perhaps until kapaala moksha 'breakage of cranium...' and from then on it is the function of this caNDaal to take care of the corpse consigned to fire and for its complete cremation, since leaving half burnt corpse to vultures and foxes or wolves, is sinning. Thus, if a Vedic scholar conducts jaata aadi kriyaaH 'rites from birth onwards...' as an initiator, whereas a caNDaal conducts antya, uttara kriyaaH 'rites of death afterwards...' as a terminator. Thus, Ravana being a Vedic scholar is now conducting himself as a self-cremator.\n"

[3-56-36]\n",
            "comment": "Is Seetha really the Goddess Lakshmi? This question is often raised and answered by commentators. Ravana kidnapped umpteen numbers of beautiful women and goddess, but why his dialogues with Seetha are given many shades of meanings by all most all commentators. Is this for proving Ravana as devotee or else to prove that Seetha is not a human but Goddess Lakshmi - is the collateral objection. Apparently, Seetha is behaving like a normal woman but latently her speeches, verbiage, or the words put by Valmiki on her tongue, indicate that she is an all-powerful enigma... without saying who she is.\nIf she is an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi how then can Ravana lift her up and carry this far - is the next dilemma, because Ravana's strength becomes useless to lift up Lakshmana who swooned on the battlefield when Ravana used Shakti missile. In Yuddha Kaanda Ch. 59 verse 111 it is said: himavaan mandaro meroH trai lokyam vaa saha amaraiH | shakyam bhujaabhyaam uddhartum na shakyo bharata anujaH\n'Ravana may have lifted Mt. Himavan, Mt. Mandara, Mt. Meru or all the three worlds along with all gods, but he could not lift up Bharata's brother Lakshmana with both of his shoulders...'\nRavana wanted to distance fiercer Lakshmana from Rama so that Rama's intensity of warring lessens. Then an episode of this lifting occurs and Hanuma on seeing this comes to Ravana and hits Ravana with fist, by which Ravana falls distantly with blood effusing from eyes, ears, and mouth. Then Hanuma easily lifts up Lakshmana and takes him to Rama. A man in swoon will not weigh differently to two different lifters. How then Ravana could not lift Lakshmana, which is not at all a great feat to Hanuma? For this the very next verse 112 gives a reply saying that:\n'even if Lakshmana is hit by Shakti missile of Brahma, he is conscious of himself as an unimaginable entity of God Vishnu, so Ravana could not lift Lakshmana. Whereas Hanuma happened to be a true devotee of God Almighty, he could easily lift Lakshmana...'\nThen the original topic of Ravana's lifting and carrying off Seetha comes to fore. She is also another unimaginable entity of Supreme Person. How then can Ravana lift her? For this it is said that Seetha allowed herself to be carried off by Ravana as she pledged in the incarnation of Vedavati.\nThe legend goes on to say that Vedavati is the brainchild of a sage called Kushadhwaja, and he decides to give Vedavati only to Vishnu in marriage. But it is an unfulfilled desire in his lifetime. Then Vedavati starts a rigorous penance to achieve her father's wish. When she is at the culmination point of her penance, Ravana passing that way in skyway sees this beautiful lady, nears, and disturbs her penance. Vedavati coming out of her meditation curses Ravana saying that she will reincarnate herself to destroy Ravana and his entire dynasty. Then she causes a yogic fire and immolates herself in it. Ravana took this as prattle by a woman-hermit, dismisses that curse, and conveniently forgets it.\nLater, Ravana being an ardent devotee of Shiva, on one day when he enters a lake to get lotuses for his daily worship of Shiva, and finds among lotuses a baby in a lotus. He brings that lotus and the baby to his palace, in all his fondness for children. But his empress Mandodari doubts the arrival of this baby in lotus and recognises that baby as Goddess Lakshmi. They consult their teachers about that baby's arrival. Those teachers, priests and pundits advise to get rid of this baby immediately, for she is Vedavati, arrived here only to end Ravana and his dynasty. Then Mandodari orders the servants to carry away this baby in a casket, and bury it.\nEmpress Mandodari further curses that girl saying: 'this faithless girl [for Wealth has no faithfulness, and this girl is recognised as Goddess Lakshmi - presiding deity of Wealth,] will thrive only in a house, where the householder has his senses conquered, and who being an emperor lives like a perfect hermit, and who though wealthy and supreme by himself, will care nothing for the riches but view whole of the world and people as his own soul, with an impartial attitude...' Mandodari thought that such a person is an impossibility to take birth in this mortal world, and thus presumed this curse to be twisty. But there is King Janaka who has all these attributes. A king without ego, wealthy one living simple, childless but yet does not crave for children, like King Dasharatha. Hence, he is called raajarshi a saintly king. While King Janaka was about to perform a Vedic ritual, he had to till some piece of land as a ceremonial act to commence that ritual. Then this casket with the baby is touched to the blade at the end of plough-beam and that plough halted. The attendants dug up that area only to find this casket with baby. The childless Janaka takes the baby into his arms and names her as 'Seetha...' where Seetha in Sanskrit means 'furrow.' This is as per aananda raamaayaNa Thus, Goddess Lakshmi became Vedavati and Vedavati became Seetha of Ramayana, as such Valmiki calls his Ramayana siithaayaH charitam mahaan...\nThen another counter objection - it is all correct to say that all puraaNaa-s say that these characters in Ramayana as gods and goddesses, as Vishnu Puraana says raaghavatve havat siitaa rukmiNii kR^iSNa jananii. But does Valmiki say it in his epic? For this it is answered, though it is not said explicitly there are many instances indicating towards this divinity of Seetha. Seetha asks Fire-god to become cool for Hanuma, when his tail is burnt saying siito bhava hanumataa and likewise she could have said hato bhava raavaNa 'dead you are Ravana...' But she does not say so for, because Rama has to undertake that process of elimination of vice called Ravana. As Seetha said in Sundara Kanda Ch. 22, verse 20: a sandeshaat tu raamasya tapasaH ca anupaalanaat | na tvaam kurmi dashagriiva bhasma bhasmaarha tejasaa ||\n'As I have no indication from Rama to burn you down, nor do I wish to waste my ascetic power, therefore I do not burn you to ashes, though you are worthy to become a mound of ash...'na apahartum aham shkyaa tvayaa raamasya dhiimataH | vidhiH tava vadha arthaaya vihito na atra samshayaH ||\n'I am un-seizable for [any] as I am the wife of bold Rama, but it happened so, for you are fated to doom [you could seize me...] undoubtedly...'\nAgain in Yuddha Kanda Brahma in eulogising Rama for eliminating Ravana says in Ch. 117, verse 28: siitaa lakshmiiH bhavaan viSNuH... 'Seetha is Lakshmi and you are Vishnu...' Like this, there are many bits and pieces of information to establish her as an incarnate of Vedavati alias Goddess Lakshmi. Govindaraja.\nThen why she and Rama behaved like humans in their wailing, moaning, and bawling is again a secondary query. This is according to loka riiti, laukika vidhaana 'humanly nature, behaviour in human world...' Though this humanly behaviour is not innate trait as Rama says aatmaanam aham maanuSam manye 'I for myself confess to be human...' Hence this humanly wailing and bawling are due to an adopted human behaviour, where incarnation itself is an adaptation.\nTheir humanly behaviour is to show themselves as one with the humans, asking humans to undergo these series of sufferings to eliminate unrighteousness, either in the society or within themselves. Besides, their mission is to make believe Ravana that they are just humans, as Ravana is killable by humans and monkeys, but not to hoodwink readers, the adherents or all of us put together. Maheshvara Tiirtha.\nThis incarceration of Seetha in Ashoka gardens is viewed as the incarceration of the innate soul in birthed being's body. The release from that body, namely moksha is achievable only when that being wants a perfect release by transcending the threefold nature consisting of sattva, rajas, tamo guNaaH 'purity, activity and stolidity...' and with an unswerving devotion to the Supreme as said in Gita, 14-26: maam ca yo avyabhicaareNa bhakti yogena sevate | sa guNaan samatiitya etaan brahma bhuuya kalpate ||\n'And such- / With single, fervent faith adoring Me, / Passing beyond the Qualities, conforms / To Brahma, and attains Me!' - Sir Edwin Arnold.\nGod Almighty is said to be masculine single, the rest of the universe is taken as feminine, as said in Vishnu Puraana: sa eva vaasudevo ayam saakShaat puruSha ucyate | strii praayam etat sarvam jagat brahma purassaram || Then the way the innate soul, called Seetha, is incarcerated is, when she had no help of the Supreme or the Adherent of the Supreme, [Rama and Lakshmana.] Then the Decahedral demon [the demon called Ten Motor Senses,] came and captured the Soul, called Seetha and incarcerated that soul in Lanka. The syllable 'lam' in the word Lanka is lam - biijaakshara which stands for earth, and because body is earthly, lascivious and carnal, the soul enters that body by its bondage. If that soul again tries for a final release, that soul shall seek the Ultimate as said in the verse of Gita, quoted above.\nThere is no instance to quote that Rama or Seetha have performed some miracles, special effects or any other optical works... perhaps due to lack of any FX studio or something like that, or due to their humanly behaviour. This wizardry is shown by demons and monkeys but not by mannish Rama or womanish Seetha. Yet Seetha is held more enigmatic than Rama. If she is not an enigma how she footslogged miles and miles in forests without hiring a taxi, and how she came out of blazing fire when she performed self-immolation after Great War? These are but two questions among many. Because these questions are never-ending and more enigmatic, because we think that we have deciphered what Rama is, it is better retain Seetha as an undecipherable enigma.\n",

As such the expressions will become: shokaat paripluta iva, shokaat pradhaavan iva, vilapan iva etc., and they mean 'as though he is inundated in sea called lamentation... as though he wept... as though he ran after...' and the like. For this the viSNu puraaNa, umaa samhita is cited as reference, where Vishnu himself says: aham daasharathiH buutvaa hanmi raavaNam aahave | shrii mad raama avataare asmin aj~navat kriyate mama | tatra shankaa na kartavyaa sarvaj~nena api maayayaa | mat maayaa mohitam rakSho manuShyam maam avekShyati | anyathaa tasya saa nuunam na bhavet atra kutracit 'I on becoming Dasharatha's son will eliminate Ravana in combat... though Omniscient I conduct myself in the incarnation of Rama as a commoner by my Maya... thereby no doubt be nurtured by any... believing me a human Ravana will be mislead, as there is no other way for his elimination...' thus Tiirtha says that Rama did not actually 'weep or wail...'\nBut this is contradicted and said by later commentators, 'though Rama is Supreme Being he took up human incarnation and he conducted himself as a human. Hence there is no need to ellipt ellipses for many a time and portray him as a 'direct' god on earth. Valmiki has said this more than once through Rama's words that he is just a 'human...' aatmaanam aham maanuSam manye 'I for myself am a human...' etc., and here also Valmiki used this word iva only at a few places like unmatta iva, udbhraanta iva Even if Rama were to be 'god' on earth, for his fate of taking a human incarnation he is fated to behave as a human, and gets involved in human emotions, according to situations and his mental conditions. In such conditions, for he is 'god' he can 'evoke' an emotion as he evoked rancour many times when eliminating demons as in the episodes of Aranya when he was eliminating Khara, Dushana, and others. There is roSam aahaarayat tiivram... 'rancour, evoking, unusual...' 'and then evoking an unusual rancour to eliminate Khara in war, he eliminated Khara...' as at 3-30-19. Here when the word roSam is replaced with shokam and if it be said as shokam aaharayet tiivram... it suffices all contradictions. And in many other places, we see him aaharayet 'getting' wrath or sadness, or other humanly emotion. When he can 'evoke' one human emotion 'wrath', why not evoke other emotions like 'love, sadness, pity, kindness' and the like. Again, there are some subhuman emotions like greed, avarice, hate, jealousy etc., which are unbefitting to humans themselves, hence the question of Rama's evoking them for his activities, does not arise.\nThen 'is this playacting of god, of hoodwinking of man called Rama in the name of Ravana...' is the connective question. The answer is 'neither...' for it is maya of Vishnu. In other way, it is not hoodwinking of Rama but it is the bewailing of god/Rama caused by the suffering of his adherents/devotee/subjects - particularly for Seetha, who is not just a devotee or adherer, but his own altar ego. Particularly when that god alone, through the so-called destiny, karma, fate etc, causes that suffering. Rama admits at verse 34 of this chapter 'this is as though I have forsaken this Seetha...' because of his passion for hunting, either the deer or the demon, thus bechanced is an ill fate on Seetha.\nIf Rama were to be god, he is not an 'featureless' god of advaita tenet, a nirguNa but he is saguNa 'featured' god and some of his many features are: svabhaavika anavadhika atishaya, j~naana, bala, aishvarya, viirya, shakti, tejaH, saushiilya, maardava, aarjava, sauhaardra, saumya, kaaruNya, maadhuryam, gaambhiirya, audaaryaadi aneka kalyaaNa guNa sampanna... of which we are concerned with kaaruNya, maardava features, 'pity and sheltering...' as Shudarshanaacaarya defined maardavam as aashrita viraha a-sahatvam maardavam 'impatience for the separation from his adherers...' and Rama wept with this pity and impatience for Seetha's separation from him.\nHowever delinquent the children be, they do not know or care to know what their parents feel about their delinquency, because they themselves are thinking that they are not at all delinquent. But their parents, though they are aware of their children's delinquency, but unable to mend them, they suffer silently or blatantly. Here too it is the same predicament for Rama, though it is not parent-child relation, but it is man-wife relation, worthier enough for more suffering. His anguish is for the 'soul' called Seetha, going to be captivated in the 'body' called Lanka, and her deliverance is possible only on the annihilation of that body or holder of that body, namely Ravana, in the karmic cycle of birth-death. And none has a real glimpse or knowledge of that god or soul, but all go on assuming on their own as Bhagavad Gita says at7-24:\navyaktam vyaktim aapannam manyate maam a-buddhaya | param bhaavam ajaananto mama avyayam anuttamam | gita\n Which deem th' Unmanifested manifest, / Not comprehending Me in my true Self! / Imperishable, viewless, undeclared, - Sir Edwin Arnold. Hence, Rama really wept for Seetha and in fact, gods really weep even for us, madly and sadly, but we do not care, or wish to care.\n",

The Ramayana upopaviSTa has its parallel n Hindi paas baiThnaa [where] baiThnaa is upa veshana which itself means to sit near upa= paas. But still paas is used with baiThnaa...' The Ramayana, A Linguistic Study, Pt. Satya Vrat. And to supplement Panditji's above saying, even in English this is evident and Oxford in saying meaning for proximity, says 'sat in close proximity to them' where 'proximity' itself is one upa and 'close' is another upa...

But to take up one in the last stanza, it bears inference like this. puraaH iva 'as before...' caaru datiim 'suavely-toothy-smiling Seetha... when she was smilingly asked me to fetch the Golden Deer, the last glimpse I had of her, still remains on my psyche... hence, in that fine fettle she shall be handed over now...' a+ ninditaam 'she is an irreproachable person for herself, no doubt, but she does not land even me into a reproachable situation even if I were to countermove the routine of universe for her, and my action stands rightful, as I am seeking her rightfully...' This argument is supported by Hanuma when he soliloquised on seeing Seetha in Lanka, saying: yadi raamaH samudra antam mediniim parivartayet | asyaaH kR^ite jagat ca api yuktam iti eva me matiH || Sundara, 16-13. 'Even if Rama is going to make this earth with its oceans, or even whole of this universe topsy-turvy for the sake of this wide-eyed Seetha, I opine that Rama is right...' Such Seetha is siitaa 'one born in a furrow, a better birth than mine, as I birthed from the womb of my mother Kausalya, like any other human...' Besides, she is maithilii 'the daughter of fitly king Janaka and thus she is a fitly consort of mine... such as she is, she is displaced by you gods in the name of fate, fortuity, and fortune... whatever it might be, bring her back to me, or else be prepared for my irreversible counteraction of this universe's routine, which perchance is manned by you, or even for its entire annihilation...' This is viirocita sambhaaSaNa 'brave talk of a braving hero...' and the mood is viira rasa 'adventurousness...' that too, not at earthly humans or animals or demons, but against the soi-disant gods.\nSo also is the ire of Arjuna in Maha Bharata. A valiantly victorious person does not sink deep into his own sorrow, but tries to counteract. Here Rama is counteracting with gods and nature, while Arjuna of Maha Bharata had to the same with his brothers and relatives. That is why Gita had to be imbibed into the mind of Arjuna, when he was at loss to know why he shall war his own brothers, teachers, grandparents et al. Having heard whole of Gita and having followed Krishna's advices, Arjuna though bewails a lot when his son Abhimanyu was murdered, becomes infuriated at the treacherous murder of the boy, and then escalated were his guts to fight back his enemies. anena shoka samaye durbala iva prabalaH shokena na siidati | kintu tat pratiikaaraaya aagraheNa mahaa rathaH pravartata iti uktam | ata eva mahaa puruShasya arjunasya abhimanyu vadha anantaram evam pravR^ittiH - droNa parvaaNi dR^ishyate - haa putra iti niHshvasya vyathito nyapatad bhuvi | pratilabhya tataH sa~Njaam vaasaviH krodha muurcchitaH || kampamaano jvareNa niHshvasantu muhurmuhuH | paaNau paaNim viniShpiShya - - - api droNa kR^ipau raajan chaadayaami taan sharaiH - - dk so on and so forth... Thus, Arjuna takes a severe oath to eliminate his enemies. Here Rama too has a Krishna like counsellor in Lakshmana, but less are Lakshmana's chances in convincing Rama, as Rama is a 'doer' rather than a 'preacher' like Krishna, or a 'student' like Arjuna. However, Lakshmana pacifies the fury of Rama in the next episode.\n",

            "": "undefinedComment: 'Here is Valmiki's blatant attempt to add too many words for one Seetha...' so some may say them as: 'Stock epithets for Sita are only three in Ayodhya kaanda, but increase in Aranya kaanda and later, all relating to her being Janaka's daughter and belonging to Mithila and Videha...' in some book called ' Epic Threads ' -- John Brockington on the Sanskrit Epics, by Greg Bailey & Mary Brockington, 366 pages, paperback, New Delhi: Oxford Univ. Press 2000; Reviewed by Pradip Bhattacharya. But we are told by tradition that these are neither stock epithets nor metre fillers, but each has its own significance. Here the word 'Seetha' is for the recollected wife Seetha, and 'Vaidehi' is for the reminisced Videha king. In the same numbered sarga of Bala Kanda 67, and even in Bala 66, Janaka harps on that 'Seetha is a valour's bounty... Seetha is a valour's bounty...' And as a son-in-law, if Rama were to face Janaka later, should he be shamefaced in not protecting Seetha... or shall Rama simply tell Janaka that 'a demon took away or ate away your daughter...' If he says so, what happens to his innumerable epithets - will be the collateral question. This is what Rama said \"Oh, kind Lakshmana, this Godavari is talking to me anything but a reply, and on coming across Vaidehi's father Janaka, also thus Vaidehi's mother-in-law and my mother Kausalya, really what is that unpleasant word that I have to say to them, in the absence of Vaidehi...' at 3-64-11, 12a. Again, these are often-repeated epithets of Seetha by Rama after the abduction of Seetha.\nSeetha is given to Rama presuming Rama to be a true valiant and befitting husband and the saviour of Seetha, as Rama established his superpower in breaking a non-liftable bow, in any dire situation. But reversed are situations in Aranya as she is likely to be abducted in its early chapters, and really abducted in later chapters. Now Rama has actually not protected Seetha, though capable enough. Leave Rama and Valmiki alone for a while in giving so many epithets to Seetha, can any self-respecting son-in-law, a protective husband, more so, a semi-super power on earth, can possibly face his father-in-law and say smilingly, 'your daughter is lost...' Hence, these 'so many epithets... that too, as Vaidehi, in particular, in this particular Aranya...' have their own meanings and subtexts, which can be known only through commentaries, unlike reading a novel. Ramayana is a dhvani kaavya ' epic with allusions...' and which word has which allusiveness is to be known first, before theorising the craft of Valmiki or the crafty interpolators. 'If the interpolators have interpolated unwittingly, will the Sanskrit grammarians and linguists keep quiet, or wage a war, until it is changed...' is the pursuant exclamation. Hence we appeal to the near extinct species called Sanskrit pundits to record somewhere as which epithet functions in which way.\n"

'But animals or birds have no faculty to perform those rituals and they have their own course of lifecycle after their demise. Then where is the question of a bird going to heaven, which heaven is scheduled to some specialists...' is the objection. But Jataayu acquired all those 'merits' when he combated without any retreat a paraa vartinaam and he is getting a short cut without undergoing too many other kinds of births, and he is given mukti 'emancipation' from lifecycles, for his action on behalf of a godlike Rama is justifiable and befitting to get a final release, by word of Rama by me cremated ritually and by me aptly consented to... where He alone can transcend the manmade rules.\n'Then the cremation, that too ritualistic one, is unavailable for birds and animals, how then can Rama perform funerals for birds, or get them performed for monkeys, as in the case of Vali...' For this it is said, 'that's why Rama had to cremate Jataayu and further said by me cremated ritually and by me aptly consented to... as sort of special sanction of mukti, because the animality has no authority in scriptures or its rites. Taking some action, endeavouring to protect dharma, or obstructing a dharma, itself is superior to mere reverencing a god, or performing a daily rot of yaj~na, yaaga-s,, etc., which in itself is a subjective performance. Here Jataayu did not attack Ravana keeping Rama or Seetha in view, but attacked Ravana only to play his part in stalling a dharma, which is not that easy, like purchasing some temple tickets to perform some ritual, for and on behalf of ticket holders and their families.\n For this it is said in nR^simha puraaNa says that mat kR^ite nidhan yasmaat tvayaa praaptaa tam dvijottama | tasmaat mama prasaadena viShNu lokam avaapyasi || 'because of me you attained your demise, thereby you get the realms of Vishnu...' where 'because of me' is to be taken not as an individual godhood, but as dharma, 'because of dharma...' itself. Hence the special sanctions to Jataayu, where such sanctions are absent in the case of Vali, as he followed the course of a dharma and there are many scripts that say Rama gave this emancipation to Jataayu, in chorus uvaaca gaccha bhadram te mama viShNo paramam padam - aadhyaatma raamaayana - raaghavasya prasaadena sa gR^idhraH paramam padam - padma puraaNa - sugrivo hanumaan R^ikSho gajo grdhrio vaNik patha - tilaka -teShu bhagavad a~NsheShu anuraagiNaH kosala nagara janapadaaH te api tan manasaaH satsaalokyataam aapuH || viShnu puraaNa\n'Has this Rama got no other work than weeping for his beloved ones and patiently performing obsequies to all lowborn, lowly subjects like dead monkey, birds, or even each individual demonic soldiers... they are all shuudra-s' is haunted feeling to some. For this it is said na shuudraa bhagavat bhaktaa vipraa bhaagavataa smR^itaa | te shuudraa ye hi a bhaktaa janaardane || 'one who is devotee of Vishnu cannot be called a shuudra... he is to be called vipra, Bhaagavata... but a non-devotee, may he be in any caste, he is a shuudra...' And shuudra is upa lakshaNa to birds or animals, thereby even animals and birds are on an even footing, if it comes to paying deference to god, and god alone is capable to decree emancipation to every or any being. 'Again it is said that Rama is god, but yet he weeps... is it not self-contradictory...' Not so, when a neighbour weeps for the hardships of his neighbour, won't the neighbourly god weep...' that too on incarnating as a human... vyasaneShu manuShyaaNaam bhR^isham bhavati duHkhitaH 'when humans are in difficulties, He wails much...' but waits much also, till those humans can correct or come over their problems on their own, keeping a little faith on Him...' Here also, the sobbing of Rama is comparatively nothing when compared to the sobbing for Seetha, because the action of Jataayu is not that sob-ful, in encountering a dharma... thus Valmiki is aware of 'good' sobbing and 'bad' sobbing in this sob-stuff, called Ramayana.\nAnd for this Dharmaakuutam says: anena mahad anuj~nayaa uttamaa gatiH bhavati it suucitam | tathaa ca adharvaNii shrutiH - yam yam lokam manasaa sa~Nvibhaati vishuddha sattvaH kaamayate yaashca kaamaan | tam tam lokam jayate taam ca kaamaaan tasmaat aatmaj~nam hi arcayet bhuuti kaamaH - bhaaShyam - ukta lakShaNam sarvaatmanam aatmatvena pratipannaH | tasya sarva aatmatvaat eva sarvaa avaapti lakShaNam phalam aaha - - - aatmaj~nam aatmaj~natena vishuddha antaHkaraNam hi arcet puujayet - ataH puujaarha eva asau |\n"

He should have advised Rama to befriend Vali, who is in power and a powerful one too, instead of Sugreeva. It is not so, is the reply from the viewpoint of dharma. This Kabandha has suffered his best in taking wrong routes and just now, he resurrected after making many amends, and he is supposed to advise Rama to go on a right path and to a right personality as Vali is already established as a pursuer of wrong path. But Vali when talking to Rama at his death time says that 'I would have brought Maithili in a single day, I would have roped Ravana and brought him like an animal tide with roe around its neck...' etc. But they are all his expressions at death-time-wisdom. He did not care for Tara's advices nor bothered to talk to Rama, as to why Sugreeva is instigated upon him. This being so, when immortal wisdom has dawned on Kabandha, he cannot ask Rama to tread a wrong path to get his task done. This is what the viewpoint of Dharmaakuutam.

            "comment": "Lakshmana's killing, dressing of birds and fishes, and Rama's munching them - is a heatedly debated topic in web forums of all sorts. Some commentators of Ramayana have totally contrived the above expressions, to give a touch of vegetarianism. Even when Rama killed Rohi animals as offerings to dead Jataayu, there also it is contrived to mean as some roots or tubers. When Seetha says to Ravana who came in the guise of Brahman friar, that Rama will fetch much meat and I offer that on cooking aamiSam aadaati puSkalam This also is contrived as some tubers and fruits.\nThis pro-Jain, pro-Buddhist touch of vegetarianism is an enforced virtue on Vedic-ism. The only and real vegetarians of India are the Jains, and Jainism is a 'holier than thou...' sect of Vedic-ism, for their hymns and biija akshara-s are nothing but the derivatives of Vedic hymns. But these are a fed up lot with the then overtures of the practisers of Vedic-ism, and cleaved themselves from Vedic-ism to form Jainism, and even today they stick to their principles of non-violence, even towards the tiniest ant. Then came this Buddhism, a 'peaceable than thou...' sect of the Vedic-ism, for their jaataka katha-s and other teachings are nothing but the Vedic lore. This ism, though called a peaceable one, meaning 'unwarlike...' has conducted many wars and is splintered manifoldly, only because of the overtures of its practisers, allowed by their patronising kings. There used to be another sect caar vaaka-s an 'intellectual than thou...' sect, but they are termed as nihilists atheists, non-believers etc., and their literature is totally ruined as they used to colloid with theists, demanding to prove god, materialistically. These are highly sophisticated, well-versed in all Veda-s, debaters with utmost precision. These three ism are not called separate religions than Vedic-ism, but a vaidika mata-s where mata is not a religion, but a philosophy, viewpoint, a darshana.\nAny religion, sect, or a following when patronised by the local sovereign, acquires bullhorns and snake fangs and starts to invade others, keeping themselves under the shade of their patronising king. So is this Buddhism, and it attained its 'warlike' tarnish by the swordsmanship of Ashoka, the Great. Besides spoiling its own original and peaceable tenets, Buddhism has equally spoiled the Vedic-ism, by the time of Ashoka itself. Even Ashoka has not converted himself to Buddhism overnight, but after a series of studies. He was a Buddhist before Kalinga war, but warred and massacred Kalinga, and a Buddhist and butchery - does not go hand in hand. By the way, Buddhists are no vegetarians, including Ashoka, but his edicts ask all others to not to eat meat.\nEven today verifiable are the dietary habits in the provinces where the preachers of Buddhism have gone or not sent, or rendered useless, say Bengal. The usual route of Buddhists of Ashoka's period is from Patna to Orissa, and to Andhra. And Andhra was stronghold of Buddhists, once when aacaarya naagarjuna was there, who established a Buddhist University in Andhra, to which students from far Japan used to come. Even today, excavations are going on and Buddhist edicts are coming out, around Naagarjuna Sagar dam. The other route from Andhra is to Sri Lanka, down south. The details about the itinerary of these Buddhists preachers, better call them as door-to-door campaigners of Ashoka's, greatness than Buddhism, can be found in their legend, the third sangiitini, masterminded by the mentor of Ashoka, namely moggali puttastha vira, , someone like Gobbels of Hitler. And rampant was this pseudo-Buddhism in South India, much abetted by the then pseudo-Jainism, to where bhadra saalastha viira was sent on his way to mahaa taamra parNi dviipa present day Sri Lanka, headed by Ashoka's son Mahinda [Mahendra, and along with the sister of Ashoka,] besides, his duuta-s to the court Antiocus II Theos [grandson of Seleucus,] Ptolemy II Philadeliphus, King of Egypt; King Antigonus Gonatus of Macedon; King Alexander of Epirus... so on. Thus, they successfully propagated about Ashoka, rather than the tenets of pure Buddhism, and as a result, that Buddhism is corrupted, back home.\nThough Buddha said at his last stage vaya dhamma sankara - appamadena sampadeta 'decay is an innate feature in all beings, acquire your salvation unfalteringly...' where appamaadena is a pramaadena 'without, carelessness...' But the later time overenthusiastic practisers decayed Buddhism carefully and unfalteringly in its homeland. In these times of Ashoka, the customs and habits of Vedic-ism merged into the then pseudo-Buddhism, and a commixture of Vedic-ism and pseudo-Buddhism resurfaced, and Vedic-ism became pseudomorphic Brahmanism. Along with it, the dietary habits have changed completely, and vegetarianism of Jainism has come to stay, and thereafter it just turned to egg-tarianism, and presently going on to hamburger-ism and pizza-ism.\nThis being so, the orthodox Hinduism lays taboo on meat eating in respect of Brahmans only, that too by reckoning the eras, the Indian yuga theory. In satya yuga no distinctions recorded, in treat yuga, dwaapara yuga-s of Ramayana and Bharata times, Brahmins are permitted only some non-veg items, called prokshita aahaara as can be seen in Rama-Vali conversation, and sage Agastya bans ram's meat, that too only for Brahmins, after Vaataapi-Ilvala episode. In kali yuga non-veg is completely banned for Brahmins, not by scriptures, but by the impact of the then despots of pseudo-Buddhism. The kali puruSa is entered through Duryodhana in dwaapara yuga of Maha Bharata time, but somehow world is saved by Krishna and Arjuna. Now we with a sarcastic affection call that kali has entered through Ashoka, and kali yuga is the period dating from Ashoka's despotic days. When a state of topsy-turviness occurs to Veda-s themselves in kali yuga , where Veda-s are breathing their last at present, there is nothing to speak of dietary habits of those eras.\nThere are many web pages saying or objecting that Rama is a practiser of a himsa not non-violence of Jains, but non-butchery of living beings. Valmiki never said that Rama is a Buddhist Monk or a vardhamaana, tiirthankara of Jainism, but depicted him as Hindu Kshatriya, and no taboo is prescribed to this warring class in eating meat or chicken. Yet the lamentation will be like this: \"Lord Rama, a great, divine exemplar of dharma and virtue for Hindus, himself apparently doesn't care much for vegetarianism and ahimsa...\" \"[Rama:] 'I must to lonely wilds repair, abstain from flesh, and living there on roots, fruit, honey, hermit's food, pass twice seven years (14 yrs.) in solitude. To Bharata's hand the king will yield the regent power I thought to wield, and me, a hermit, will he send my days in Dandak wood to spend.' \" -- Ramayana 2:20. [Griffith, Ralph T.H. The Ramayana of Valmiki: translated into English verse. Benares: E.J. Lazarus & Co., 1895. p.117]. It may please be noted that vegetarianism is different from non-violence and it belongs only to Jain tenets, and later to Gandhian principles, but not to Hindus or Buddhists. The meaning of the above verse is 'being a hermit I will abstain from food that inculcates raajasa, taamasa pravR^itti an aggressive, assaulting mood... where certain kinds of meat stuff cause an aggressive mood...' and Griffith had his own metrical exigencies to incorporate all the subtexts and underlined meanings in those iambics. It is unclear as to why hairs are counted on eggshells, without grasping the essence of the epic's idea of eliminating vice, where vice is Ravana and his diabolic activities. Rama's character may not be taken as a meek, weak, bleak backbencher, but take it as a blitzkrieg assaulter, aggressive invader, that too only on vice. If he were not to kill an edible animal how can he create a holocaustic extirpator of demons in the last episodes of the epic, or shall he start chanting on battlefield dhammam sharaNam gaccaami, sangam sharaNam gaccami that too, to Ravana - needs to be explored. Firstly let us ask ourselves whether we want a Ravana or a Rama, whether they eat meat, chicken 65, or biryaani, or Italian ice creams.\nWhether Rama is a god or no god, he is the princely Kshatriya, and if a warrior Kshatriya subsists on tubers and fruits, and on other insipid food, we can imagine how grand his warfare would be. If Rama were to be a god, why God created a big fish that eats a small fish, why birds and animals of prey, and why a niSaada that kills a bird at the start of Ramayana. Hence, taking dietary habits as acquired habits, but not godsend or tabooed ordinances of scriptures, the meanings of these verses of Kabandha are not contrived to establish any vegetarianism. Incidentally, these are the advices of raw-flesh eating Kabandha and we do not see Rama feasting comfortably on birds, fish, or on Kentucky chicken, at Pampa.\n",

            "comment": "Out of the three epithets for Rama, the twice-repeated epithet is puruSarSabha has two different meanings in vernacular translations. One is the usual intensifier puruSa R^iSabha 'bull among men...' where The Bull is the bull from the zodiacal sign or constellation Taurus to that of stock exchanges. And it is Latin bulla 'rounded object', in medieval Latin 'seal' or Latin bullire 'to bubble', from bulla 'bubble' etc., where Rama is the rounded off seal for kingship, and even known for his bubbly fermentation to deal with atrocities. The other is puruSa tilaka 'the vermilion mark one the forehead of mankind...' rather the husband of mankind, or the husbandman for mankind who cultivates good on the earth as a farmer, after weeding out the weeds called evils. The version of Gita Press has this as the 'flower of humanity...'\nAnd then it is said in vernacular translations as a 'bullish man' is for his impetuousness and aggressiveness towards evil called Ravana, when he started from Ayodhya. The second is to tell that he is a yeoman, a man holding and cultivating a small landed estate, taking care of every weed or withering plant, as he has come to see Shabari, and Shabari like an old plant did not stir out. The third is puruSa vyaaghra 'manly tiger...' but this is actually 'man, the lion...' and if a lion sets out he will not take a back step until his pursuit is fulfilled. Thus Shabari is given the lines with three epithets to Rama, as she is already in the know of this Rama, and now on seeing him personally, some divine wisdom dawned and she is able to foresee what this man, rather this lion, is going to achieve at end point. We glean these meanings, one, or two, and we appeal to Sanskrit pundits to derive which epithet is used with which purpose, once again.\nBy the way, where is the scene of Rama eating fruits and eatables bitten and tasted by Shabari? Has this old woman not offered the fruits to the guests, or just said that they are available? We listen many stories and see many pictures telling that she gave many fruits after biting them with her own teeth to test the taste. All that is not in Valmiki Ramayana.

That way, she is a bahiSkR^itaam - api samiipaat ' not, debarred lady, even, from the proximity' of Vedic-rituals.

This metaphor of a snake shedding off skin is repeated time and again in Ramayana and here the commentator is using it. This is indicative of the thousand hooded serpent aadiseSa who guards Vishnu like a mosquito net. The fibre like sheath released by a snake will be beautiful for a look as it glitters with all the charms of a charming snake. The minute you finger it, of course when snake went a long way off, then that sheath splinters in hundreds of pieces. That is why this metaphor is used to suggest the world as viSNu maya, which remains beautiful and if touched shatters all misconceptions. Saint-singer Tyaagaraaya has a kR^iti on this pannagapu doma tera paikettavemayya… So Shabari is rid of that illusion, or maya…\nAt the outset let us say that there is no Hinduism as such but bhaaratiiya sanskR^iti is there, and that is not concentrated in an around Indus valley alone. So also there is no caste system in India, but it is to be called varNa, varga categorisation, class, social stratification etc. Oxford has this to say for the word caste - Spanish and Portuguese casta 'lineage, race, breed', fem. of casto 'pure, chaste' and we are still lingering ourselves to the unwitting misnomer of Portuguese. In Ch. 1 of Bala Kanda, we put this as - Brahman - teacher-class; Kshatriya - ruler-class; Vyshya - trader-class; Shudra - worker-class. And if the word 'class' is also a pungent word let us use this Latin word classis 'assembly...' a near relative of varNa, varga and which does not mean the colour of skin, but it is meant to be a group. Thus the groups or assemblages are classis of intelligentsia and classis of sovereignty and classis of commerce and classis of peasantry or smithery or its various branches. Unfortunately, this word is mixed up to mean nonsense, and it remained to mean only as 'casta' of Portuguese. If it were to mean bloodline, race, or caste, then to which bloodline Kshatriya-s belong, either to Solar dynasty or to Lunar dynasty. Likewise to which bloodline the many kinds of Brahmans, say Vaidic, Niyogi, Bhatt, Caturvedi, Dwivedi, Iyer, Iyyangar, Namboodri etc., belong. By the way, what is the caste of Parashu Rama, or Bhaargava Rama, the sixth incarnation of Vishnu on earth and generally ascribed as a Brahman? His father is Jamadagni, said to be a Brahman, and his mother is Satyavati, the sister of Vishvamitra, a Kshatriya. Thus, the present day confusion and wrong terminology do not apply to Vedic times, because they believed in the 'seed-and-field syndrome' biija kshetra nyaaya and perhaps a phenomenon recently found may match it - ``when we look at the Y-chromosome DNA, we see a very different pattern. The lower castes are most similar to Asians, and the upper castes are more European than Asian... Further, when we look at the different components within the upper caste, the group with the greatest European similarity of all is the warrior class, the Kshatriya, who are still at the top of the Hindu castes, with the Brahmins... But the Brahmins, in terms of their Y-chromosomes, are a little bit more Asian - So the genetic results are consistent with historical accounts that women sometimes marry into higher caste, resulting in female gene flow between adjacent castes. In contrast, males seldom change castes, so Y chromosome'' so says geneticist Lynn Jorde of the University of Utah.\nThis discussion has its orientation in the word shramaNii prefixed to Shabari, which originally means a Hindu wandering friar, not to be confused with the monk of Buddhism. Many take her to be a tribal or lowborn woman, and puzzle about the availability of Vedic knowledge or yogic practise to her. It is pertinent to ask why lowborn people and women were not authorised to perform Vedic rituals. We may see the queens of Dasharatha have performed Ashvamedha ritual in Bala Kanda. So women are not barred. Then the classis laboris had a different kind of labour to undertake, than this relax -less labour of rituals. So, their manpower was used that way and the brainpower of these Vedic pundits was used this way. The difference belonged more to the occupational interests than congenital inheritance. The lateral thinking or the vertical thinking changed them, and it is now we have a counter-culture than that of Vedic times. We still see sons and daughter of film actors, industrialists, or politicians becoming father-like, but sons of washermen and shore-makers are turning out differently.\nThough Shabari is given a direct charge-free flight to heaven but poor Shambuka, another shuudra, is eliminated by Rama. Shambuka is neither a poor, innocent, meekish shuudra. He had to be eliminated when he was practising haTha yoga 'meditating upside down...' only to conquer the world with his negative logic like Ravana. He is not even a Yogi, but a bhogi, enjoyer and one who started his mission with half-knowledge with para apakaara dharma. But Shabari is a yogin by her aatma samaadhi, that too a reverential lady by her steadfastness in what she believed sva dharma.\nRegarding the accessibility of Vedas or Vedic knowledge to each and every body, the first question that arises is 'what for it is required by everyone?' If the answer is 'to know what Vedas say...' then the reply is, 'sun rises in east, cloud brings rain, so it is to be worshipped, and beyond it there are some forces to cause all this, so they are to be known, by which you obtain heaven... this Vedas say...' Therefore, this knowledge was unnecessary for the commoners in those days, because they were on heaven-like earth, so we presume by epics. And there are no such episodes where such questions were raised by some characters. Even Vali, a vanara was an adherer of Veda-s. This knowledge is now sought for because earth is turning into hell. But if Vedas are required for practising to purchase a direct ticket to heaven, the episode of Trishanku is there to tell us what sort of heaven we gain by short-cut methods. Even if they are taught to one and all and all sit chanting those hymns, since it appears to be an easy job to chant un-understandable hymns, gone is the agriculture, commerce, defence etc., to dogs.\nSuch a state of turmoil has occurred with the advent of Buddhism and its relative conversions. Then the Magadha and Maurya empires have utterly outdone the Kshatriya-s, by hiring mercenaries as their army. When the defence of a tradition itself is defeated then that tradition had to crumble, and in to that crumbling tradition, many outlandish traditions have intruded to intermingle, so says our known history. But when the question of - caste vs. Vedas - arises, there are many caste-less characters in Veda made eligible to learn Vedas, for e.g., Jaabaala Satyakaama, vide channdogya upaishad 4-4-1 to 4-4-5. Adi Shankara's commentary on Brahma sutra-s 34-38 refuses the right of practising Vedas by Shudra-s, but his maniiSaa pancakam salutes a caNDaala - caNDaalo astu sa tu dvijostu... 'may he be a Brahman or a Profaner, salute him [who has right knowledge about the Absolute...] This appears self-contradictory, but not so, because the ritual acts are prohibitive to women and shuudra-s, but not knowledge or personal excellence in it. Admittance of everyone in every sphere of activity is as good as admitting a nondescript into an operation theatre when heart transplantation is going on. Or, asking an airhostess to build a space shuttle because she has more flight hours on her record. Why all of them, some categories of Brahmans are not allowed in certain areas of rituals though conducted by Brahmans. Vedas say that it is a difficult path to follow them: uttiShTha jaagrata praapya varaan nibodhata | kShurasya dhaaraa nishitaa dur atyayaa duram pathaH tat kavayo vayanti || 1-3-14 kaThopaishad 'Arise Awake, resort to best teachers to know 'That...' it is a walk on the razor's edge, difficult to follow, so the wise say...' then, why walk on a razor blade when air-conditioned roads of VB, Java, C , Oracle are there, like Vishvamitra who has taken many chapters to become Brahmin pundit, for no practical purpose. Vedic culture is different to Puranic culture, Puranic culture differs with epical, where examples are Lakshmana's boundary line to Seetha, and Shabari's tasting fruits before giving them to Rama, from Padma Purana, and everything or anything of that time is unavailable now, except these palm-leaf books and this pseudo-casteism. Anyway, let bygones be bygones, and let Veda or Vedic knowledge remain in a showcase of some archaeological museum, and let us revert to the story telling. So in conclusion it is to be said whether Shabari is the Spanish casto lady or Indian shramaNi she got what she wanted by her own sva dharma , and the portrayal of her divinity in the last but one verse is enough to tell whether she is lowborn human, or high-rising angle.\nThough we may not elicit the caste, creed, or classis of Shabari, but she is an important Yogic character according the viewpoint of Yoga on Ramayana. In Yoga kunDalini 'the cosmic power in living being...' has a good part to play. It flows though the Sympathetic and Para-sympathetic ganglions though bio plexuses. If we take Ramayana as a humanoid epic, and the gist of the epic as its life force, that force has an upward movement via these ganglions. By the boons of Kaika this élan vital of Ramayana has moved from its serpentine coil reposing in muula aadhaara cakra sacro-coccygeal plexus, and reaches svaadhiSTaana cakra sacral plexus, when Bharata takes Rama's sandals to enthrone, and then it ascends and spends time in maNipuuraka cakra, the lumbar plexus, in the solacing laps of great saints and hermits like Atri, Anasuya, Agastya, and then it ascends and listens to the noise made by Kabandha at anaahata cakra cardiac plexus, where an aahata is 'un beaten...' a sound made without any external beating, the lub-dub beating of heart. That noise of heart will be unbearably noisy for cardiac patients. So is the thunderous voicing of Kabandha on his entry. This élan vital of Ramayana, which started with its primeval pureness, touches water and fire in earlier plexuses and now is ready to touch air at cardiac plexus. And air wants an egress and the story wants to go to the next plexus vi shuddha cakra 'very clean, pure, friendly and pleasant area...' laryngeal plexus, that of clean Pampa, pure vanara-s, friendly Sugreeva, Hanuma, and pleasant Rishyamuka. But where is outlet for that agonised 'airing of heart' of the epic? Frail Shabari is that slender duct-stem of a lotus, and through her, viz., on exiting her, the story enters into an area where the problems of the characters can be explained to other characters. Having spent some time there, then it enters aaGYaa cakra the ordering plexus in between brows. One does what his mind orders. Here that mind is Sugreeva and irrefutable are his orders. When vishuddha cakra is available at throat, svaadhiSTaana cakra is there at sacral place. The area from throat to sacrum is madhya kuuTa Vali's birth is from this place and Sugreeva's birth is from throat of their father turned mother. And what that is throated by Sugreeva is the activity of aaGYaa cakra and Seetha is found thereby... - after raamayaNa paramaartham by Dr. Ilapaavuluuri Panduranga Rao, a T.T.D publication.\n",
