This apart, the dhanurveda science of archery, itself is treated as 'an exclusive Veda taught to warriors...' The dhanurveda is not to be construed as simple bow and arrow and 'shooting the target' education. It is a 'scripture on missiles' that existed in those ages.\nDown the memory lane, O. A.Vijayan, the eminent Indian journalist has reflected in The Illustrated Weekly of India, that the Soviet scholar Dr. A. A. Gorbovsky said in his article with heading Ancient India may have had N-arms , in the Statesman, with dateline Moscow, Sept. 8, 1986. Among other things, the scientist observes by the stanzas that describe the disaster caused by such astra-s, now loosely termed as a well crafted bow and sky rocketing arrows, as below:\n'A blazing shaft which possessed all the effulgence of smokeless fire was let off... all directions were enveloped by darkness... the very elements seemed to be perturbed... the sun seemed to turn... the universe, scorched with heat, seemed to be in fever... the survivors lost their hair and nails... for years the sun and sky remained shrouded with clouds...'\nThus the narration goes on. This is the account of Brahmaastra, as in Mahabharata, the other Epic of India. Thus the Dhanurveda may be taken as the canon of missile sciences, which fortunately has not been handed over to the successive generations, lest everything would have been annihilated by now. In Ramayana too, which is much earlier to Mahabharata, there are elaborate accounts of such astra-s in the coming chapters. Sage Vishvamitra, who is well-versed in warfare, gives many such weapons to Rama. For now, these bow and arrow references may not be taken as those of Robin Hood.\n"

Likewise Rama personally gets unaffected, whatever harm is done to him, but he becomes wrathful, if that harm is committed to dharma.\nThitherto, the Bala Kanda is narrated by these narrations of sparkled in Ikshvaku dynasty 'Rama's incarnation...' highly valorous, enemy subjugator... 'elimination of demoness Tataka, subdual of the vanity of Parashu Rama...' propitious 'marriage with Seetha, knows Art of Archery 'receiving missiles from Vishvamitra...' From now poet tells the Ayodhya Kanda, and a gist of this magnum opus is given here itself. This narration is known as baala raamayana - saMkShepa raamaayaNa meaning that it is aimed at youngsters as it has been told in an abridged version. In the endnote, details about this version and still abridged version, called Gayatri Ramayana, are given.\nReaders may find an inordinate use of ellipses in translation of the epic. But they are 'a must.' Pt. Satya Vrat, the author of Ramayana - A Linguistic Study says: \"Ellipsis is the peculiarity of the style of the older works like Ramayana... their writings, as they stood, yielded incomplete sense which has to be supplemented by adhyaahaara, viz., supply of words, that would fit in the context... Indeed, in most cases the ellipsis could be readily understood and would suggest the word or words that would make it up...' We therefore request the readers to go by the meaning of the context, than by the order of words, for there is a saying... paaThakrame arthakramo baliiyaH... So, this adhyaahaara, supply of words, may not be that faithful while rendering from Sanskrit to English.\n"

Dutt.\nThis verse has many comports of which a few are given hereunder:\nThis verse is taken as ma~NgalaacaraNa to Ramayana, for any epic has to have ma~Ngalaaadiini; ma~Ngalamadhyaani; ma~Ngalaantaani   A good pious beginning, pious middle and pious ending.\nBecause this verse has the letter maa at its start and maa is lakShmii vaacaka in Sanskrit. It is aadivarNaH The first letter  lokamaataa maa ramaa ma~Ngaladevataa thus amarakosha says for Goddess Lakshmi.\nmaa= Goddess Lakshmi; niShaada= Oh! Vishnu [ for Goddess Lakshmi resides in the heart of Vishnu - niShadiiti asmin iti niShaada ]; yat = by which act; krouncamithunaat = the couple of demons, namely Ravana and Mandodari; kaamamohitam= that impassioned one and stole Seetha; ekam= that one, Ravana; avadhiiH= you killed; by that act of yours;  shaashvatiissamaa= everlasting for ages; pratiShTaam= divine sanctity; tvam agamaH= you, get.\n\"Oh, the abode of Goddess Lakshmi, namely oh, Vishnu, by which act of your killing one male demon named Ravana, who in his passion abducted Seetha, and thus you eradicated the vice from the earth, for that you get an everlasting divine sanctity, as Rama, for ages to come.\"\n2] Next niSaada is attributable to Ravana, because he is the one who tortures others for his benefit. itaraam saadayati piiDayati iti niSaada thus: Oh! Ravana; krounchamithunaat= from the couple, say Rama and Seetha, who are flying from forest to forest like nest-less birds; ekam= one is, Seetha is; avadhiiH =you almost killed her by your torture of abducting her; pratiSTaam= your glory in Lanka, at its zenith, as per the kindness of Brahma; maa agamaH= never get, hereafter. But this declination is not held right, for it is like a curse, shaapa, and no epic starts with a curse.\n3] Next, this verse is said holding Rama in the perspective. Sage Narada gave the details of the legend to Sage Valmiki because Brahma ordered that the legend of Rama is to be recorded. But Ramayana is full of pathos, karuNa-shoka-rasa-pradhaana. If it is to be penned the writer too shall have heart that can outpour that mood. So when Valmiki is at the river banks, Rama, say Vishnu, came in the guise of a tribal, as with other mythological episodes like kiraataarjuniiya etc., to test the capability of Valmiki in narrating pathos, and killed one bird. Valmiki reacted immediately and Vishnu's test is complete. But in exciting the mood of such holy sage, Vishnu / Rama gets a curse like separation from wife, as below.\nniShaada= oh tribal: Rama to Valmiki / Vishnu to mythology; for your killing one bird of the couple, to the misery of the female one; shaashvatiiH = as long as you live on this earth; samaaH pratiSTaam= togetherness, with your wife; maa agama= do not get.\nOh! Rama, as long as you are on earth, you do not get the love of being together with your wife, because you killed one from the bird couple... and you have to live with your wife departed [to Lanka,] come again, and then departed [to forests.]\nBut this is differed statement, since Vishnu does not require any personal testing of the capabilities of the writer of Ramayana. Brahma will look after such literary things.\n4] The generally accepted meaning of this verse is this. Any epic's gist is to be said at the start or, at its commencement --- kaavyaarthasuucanam aadaaveva niruupyate---  Thus, the above verse included the meaning of whole of the epic, Ramayana.\ni] maa niSaada= Goddess Lakshmi and Vishnu. Their marriage in their incarnations as Rama and Seetha, and Ramayana depicts this in Bala Kanda.\nii] pratiSTaam tvam agamaH= renown, you get, by following your father's orders you have repaired to forests, without any political upheaval, thus get an everlasting renown as an obliging son Ayodhyaa Kanda.\niii] shaashavatiissamaa= by dwelling in forest and eradicating demons and helping the saints and sages thus, you achieve an everlasting praise Aranaya Kanda.\niv] krounchayoH= from the [atrocious] couple; k-- krunca gati kauTilya alpiibhaavayoH; the atrocious Vali, and Tara couple; ekam kaamamohitam = passion filled one, i.e., Vali; avadhiiH= you killed, you killed Vali KiShkindhaa Kanda.\nv] krounchamithunaat= from the couple of lovely passionate birds here Rama and Seetha; niSaada that ruffian Ravana, kaamamohitam lustfully, ekam one [i.e., Seetha]; avadhiiH = almost killed, i.e., her residing in Lanka is as good as death Sundara Kanda.\nvi] krounchamithunaat = from the atrocious, couple Ravana and Mandodari; ekam avadhiiH you killed one [Ravana] Yuddha Kanda.\nvii] kaamamohitam= fascinated by desire, [ kaama also means a longing, desire, let alone lusting]; Seetha is fascinated by her desire to see sage's wives in uttara Ramayana and thus she is sent to forests through Lakshmana. Hence seventh canto, uttara Ramayana is also suggested.\n"

Of these four only the first three, dharma, artha, kaama are usually referred, and they are called tri-varga . The final one mokSha is not often quoted. Dhrama is the driving force. chodanaa lakShaNaartho dharmaH - Jaimini. Hence dharma is the prescribed conduct, either by scriptures or by the society, and it does not entail any merit or demerit, but just an obligatory conduct or duty or, say 'categorical imperative' of Kant. And the other two, artha, kaama , are the means of dharma, and all leading to moksha. These two great epics Ramayana and Mahabharata are structured on these puruSaartha -s alone. Thus though Ramayana is abounding with the accounts of richness and glory of all kinds of wealth, which is secondary to human values, its main import is the virtuosity of human living. The ocean, though abounding with other less valuable items like conch shells, mother-of-pearl shells etc., its gems beneath all these peripherals are of high value. Thus this is an ear pleasing by its musical melody and heart pleasing by its meaningful wording. Further, it is pleasant for its import is in accordance with all the scriptures.\n"

If Uttara Ramayana, otherwise called abhudaya-kaanDa, is ascribed to Valmiki, the cantos are seven and chapters are about 649 and verses are about 24,253. But some verses and chapters are deleted for standardization of Ramayana as per this verse and they contain 560 chapters and 24,00 verses only. Some argue that when it is said 24,000 verses are there, it does not actually a mathematical assertion, like the calculation of mahaayuga -s and manvantara -s, and as one would give a reply to his age as 30 years, or 60 years, but not as 29 years, 6 months, seven days or so... In furthering that standardization affair, some said that even this canto, Bala kaanda is not authored by Valmiki. It is not clear as of now when the pundits can decide as to which is standard and which is not.\nThe transcendental aspect of Ramayana and its content is explained in 18 terms by ancient commentator Govindaraja. 1] Rama's Absoluteness, paramaatmatattva ; 2] Ideation to know Him, upaaya ; 3] Dedication in Him, kainkarya ; 4] Human aspect, puruSaakaara ; 5] Diviner, adhikaara ; 6] Resolve in God, adhikaarapaaratantrya ; 7] God's resolve in Dedicate, bhagavatpaaratantrya ; 8] Knowledge of five Meanings, arthapancakaj~naana ; 9] Self-denial, akincanatvam ; 10] Teacher selecting, aacaaryavaraNam ; 11] Climax, autkaNThataa ; 12] Behaviour, pravartanaa ; 13] Residence, vaasasthaana ; 14] Two Narayana hymns, naaraayaNamantradvaya ; 15] Gayatri, Gayatri hymn; 16] Negating negative-thinking, durvicaaraparihaara ; 17] negating Love for Living, samsaarajihaasa ; 18] 64 Divinely Arts, catuHSaSTi-kalaamayatva . Of them we take up the 15th Gayatri.\nThe identification of Gayatri with Ramayana scheme is explained in many ways. By tat savitR^i the features and attributes of the Absolute as per narrations in Bala Kanda. vareNya by the narration of Absolute's attributes in Ayodhya and Kishkindha kaanda-s, and adherents like Lakshmana, Bharata, Sugreeva take shelter in Him here only. bharga is identified as per the description of resplendence of The Divine as envisaged by the sages and hermits in Aranya Kanda. devasya and in dhiimahi where that deva the Divine is explained by Hanuma, not only to Seetha but to all in Sundara kanda. hi dhii mahi is as explained in Uttara Kanda, which centers around mokSha salvation.\n"

These countries Kambhoja, Bahlika, Vanayu may not be taken as the provincial countries within the present day India. Prior to the present-day peninsular India, the belt from Himalayas to Alps had a great rapport in cultural and trade exchanges without demarcations of east or west, which paved the way for Alexander, the Great, towards India.\nSometime back, say during 1985-87, the National Geography magazine contained a beautiful article under the heading \" IRAQ, the crucible of civilisation ,\" Merle Severy, as its Asst. Editor. In its carefully worded introduction, it is stated that Iraq is \"the traditional birthplace of man for Jews, Christians and Muslims... \" On the other hand, Hindus naturally believe that the Southward Himalayan region is the birthplace of man. In the same article, the regions around Euphrates and Tigris are said to be the \"Fertile Crescent, the cradle of Western civilization ... in the third millennium BC \". Further that \" To the east a similar florescence occurred in the Indus and Yellow River Valleys... \" This florescence in Indus Valley and far eastward did not occur later to Mesopotamian or Babylonian civilisations but flourished much earlier, as per Hindu scripts and the dating of which is the eternal question like Aryan Question. However, Hindu scripts centre the present world, Bhuuloka, surrounding Meru Mountain and its geography includes the land unto Rome, Russia, China. We will refer to Meru mountain-oriented geography and its geographical account at the appropriate place. Since Ramayana dates back to Buddhism and Buddhism's westward spread is unto Afghanistan, the Kings of Ramayana must have had no problem to draft horses from Persian, Arabian or the other of Middle East countries. These countries are always famous for horse breeding, right from the days of Ramayana to Moses. Hence the accounts of horses and the countries from where they are brought may be treated as cross-continental culture. Since history believes only in the unearthed iconography and the epics or their content can not stand to the carbon-testing, the countries named here as Kambhoja, Baahlika may nearly mean Babylonian, Mesopotamian, Arabian or other unknown or unearthed historic countries of the crucible of Western civilisation, Iraq. Vanaayu, another country referred may nearly mean Roman, as Persians term Greeks as Unani in India, advent to the arrival of Alexander, the Great. We still have an herbal medication called Unani, a hybrid between Ayurveda, Greek and Persian herbal treatments.\n"

Here Dasharatha is bringing Sage Rishyasringa to Ayodhya. Earlier Indra led Vamana, the dwarf-boy to heavens. Vamana is the incarnation of Vishnu in early ages and after Vamana suppressed Bali, the Emperor to netherworlds, Indra took Vamana to heavens. Thus Dasharatha is like Indra on earth, both by his virtue and deed. Incidentally, Vamana i.e., Vishnu, is the son-incarnate to Sage Kaashyapa, while sage Rishyasringa is the grandson of the same Kaashyapa. Thus Sage Kaashyapa is instrumental to these two incarnations.

            "": "undefinedVedic yajna-s are the rituals of many kinds. Mainly there are 21 types of these yajna-s, 1] saptapaaka-yajna-s are 7; 2] saptahaviryajna-s are 7; 3] saptasoma-yajna-s are 7. Apart from these rituals, there are rituals for the overall development of society at large, called abhyudayaka-yajna-s and under them categorised are: 1] ashvamedha, 2] raajasuuya, 3] paunDariika, 4] bR^ihaspati sava, and some more are there. These grand scale rituals require a great patronage and support, not only of money but also of a variety of paraphernalia that go into the ritual. Hence only kings and emperors of yester years could conduct them.\nThe yaaga shaala The Hall of Vedic ritual will be erected with platforms containing areas 1] yuupa stambha-s wooden posts to which the animals are tied. There will be 21 such posts, staked in the Vedic ritual hall, along with a half post staked near at the main altar; 2] uttara vedi, posterior platform; 3] dasha pada, platform for scholars; 4] havirdhaana, place for oblatory paraphernalia; 5] sadas, place for assemblages; 6] agnihotra shaala, place of sacrificial fire; 7] vedi, main Altar of Fire; 8] patnii shaala, place for the wife / wives of the performer and other females. The main activity of the ritual is around the vedi, the 7th item as above, where a garuDa vedi, an Eagle shaped Alter of Fire will be constructed with bricks, where the brick laying and paving itself is a ritual, called iSTikaa chayana . Into this yajna vedi, Altar of Fire, all the oblations are poured.\nThe Hindu temples will be built in accordance with the layout of yajna shaala, since the daily puuja, at home or in a temple, is a micro-yajna, equable to Vedic Ritual itself. The layout of the temple is comparable to the above layout of yajna shaala .\n1] dhavaja sthambha, flag post; 2] bali griha, sacrificial house; 3] bali piiTtha sacrificial platform, where usually the fruits, coconuts, prasada, food items etc., are presented to the deity firstly, before the devotee partakes them, as a kind of sacrifice; 4] havirdhana, preparatory places for havis, the food for sacrifice, usually in north-east or south-west corners; 5] mandapa open hall, where Vedic recitations are chanted; 6] garbha griha, sanctum sanctorum, in this there are two places one is, 7] pratishtha, the place where the picturesque idol is installed, and the other, 8] shakti sthaana, where the power of the installed deity will be installed, in the form of an yantra, a geometrical layout or other form. [For more information, please turn to The cultural Heritage of India, Vol IV, Religion.]\nThe next epitome of yajna, is human body. It is said that deho devaalayaH proktaH ‘human body itself is a temple...’ The above places of Ritual Hall or a Temple are located on body as this: 1] sthuupi [kalasha], the top most golden pot of flagpoist of temple; 2] mahaa nashi the right nostril and kshudra nasi, left nostril; 3] shikhara, temple tower; 4] ghaTa, neck like structure; 5] prastaaram, shoulder like structure of temple; 6] paada, trunk of temple; 7] adhiSTaana, elevation; 8] upapiiTha, secondary seating. This is compared with human body as: Item 1] to human pate with hair-locks; 2] eye - on right and nose on left [for humans have one-eyed vision of God, where God is Omniscient; 3] face; 4] neck; 5] shoulders; 6] arms; 7] leg and thigh; 8] foot.\n‘A temple is not a home of god but it is the form of god... the temple layout is the extended form of the rhythm of the innerspace of humans, called dahara aakaasha similar to cosmos of the universe...' [cf. What is a temple? What is its significance? Ganapathi Sthapati, Vaastu Vedic Research Foundation, Chennai, India.] Thus human body itself is identified with the temple, and the temple in turn with Vedic yajna shaala , and therefore it is said to keep the body clean and mind pure... which again is a Vedic import.\nThe grand scale yajna-s as described in these epics like Ramayana and Maha Bharata are non-existent. But in recent times, such types of yajna-s were conducted on two occasions, once in 1975 and again in 1990. Here are some excerpts from The Indian Express, daily newspaper, published during May 1990: ‘Prof. Frits Staal, with financial assistance from several American funding agencies including the Smithsonian Institute and the Rockefeller Foundation, organized the agni chayana ritual in 1975. In spite of innumerable hurdles, Staal succeeded in persuading the elderly nambudri-s [scholarly priests of Vedic lore] to put together a team of ritualists old and young, give them through training, hold rehearsals for several months and finally put up performance for filming and documentation. Staal followed this up with the publication of his book called Agni ...'\nReaders who are interested to know more about yajna, the Vedic ritual, may please look for the works of Prof. Frits Staal, Indologist, at whose instance such rituals were conducted in Southern India. The two-volume book of Prof. Frits Staal: AGNI: The Vedic Ritual of the Fire Altar, running over some two thousand pages. Another book is The Mantra, which is an attempt to analyse the Vedic Hymns, published by State University of New York Press, State University Plaza, Albany, N.Y., 12246, also now available with Indian Book Centre, Delhi\nAccording to Staal, a Vedic ritual is very different from a health cure, a psychoanalyst session, an anthropological meeting or a religious service. Staal maintains that a Vedic ritual follows its own principles and leads a life of its own. He points out that a Vedic ritual requires very detailed and specific knowledge. He estimates that the extent of specialised knowledge needed to put the sacrificial altar together ritually is on a par with the extent of technical knowledge required to build an aeroplane. ‘The bird shaped altar is in fact a kind of aeroplane…’ says Stall ‘only it takes off in a different way…’ Scientific evaluations were also made on the changes occurred on physical and metaphysical levels on the individuals who performed the ritual, by experts from Canada and in association with Prague Institute of Czechoslovakia. Kirlion photography was also undertook by Mrs. Rose Mary Steel from London to record aura or the Electro-magnetic radiation around the human organism and hundreds of pictures of not only the performers but also of the visiting people and of their finger tips are recorded.\nUsually at the end of any Vedic ritual the Hall of Ritual, a thatched shed, will be put to fire. This called puurNaahuti, complete oblation into fire. And then a rain occurs. It used to rain every time when the ritual is totally offered as an oblation into fire at the conclusion of such a ritual. ‘The association between the yajna and rain is indelible. Did it rain on [the day of puurNaahuti ] i.e., May 9, 1990? It did...’ The Illustrated Weekly of India, May 27, 1990.\n",

            "comment": "Hindu mythology has no devils, but has only raakshasa -s, who can hardly be called demons, either. Not all the raakshasa-s are evil-doers. Some of the raakshasa-s are the fallen angels who take birth as mortals. They have their Vedic education, and they perform Vedic rituals and penance etc., thereby they get the patronage of any one of the gods among the Hindu Trinity, viz., Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. On attaining the cherished boons, they suddenly revolt against their own patron deities and commence the atrocities only to conquer the Heavens, knowing well that they cannot be attained with a mortal body. In order to snub the upsurge of such violence or the unnatural ascension to Heaven, the deity who gave the boons seeks the help of any of the other two of the Trinity. Then one from the Trinity will take birth as mortal, as an incarnation of god on earth. Usually Vishnu incarnates himself to eradicate the evils created by the intrepid raakshasa-s.\nHere the celestials bring in a preamble for Vishnu's incarnation as Rama and thus the topic of Ravana occurs in this chapter of Ramayana. Ravana need not be taken as an evil spirit, devil, hobgoblin or a monstrous being. He is said to be a Brahman well versed in all Vedas, musicologist, and a great king of Lanka, with unlimited riches, and very many of his clansmen with their vast dominions, and what not. Though Brahma and Shiva bless Ravana with boons, Ravana flouts all the norms in conquering Heavens in which course he did not hesitate to torture anyone who becomes his personal hurdle or hindrance. Hence it is inevitable for the Trinity to curb Ravana's atrocities, and Vishnu will now be requested by all the deities to incarnate himself on earth. As such, the expression of the word \"DEMON\" may not always be taken as an ugly and monstrous looking devil or Satan, as per the usual religious conceptualisation of evil.\nIn Hinduism evil is not a separate entity from humans, but available in the same personification and resides along with virtue, like the two sides of a coin. These raakshasa-s are also mortals, extraordinary beings with extraordinary powers like god incarnates. But, with wickedness in their will, monstrosity in mind and a conqueror's ambition in their heart, they are rendered themselves as demons.\n"

[1-15-16, 17]\n",
            "comment": "Vishnu is a four handed deity. He handles a Divine Lotus suggesting that he is the creator sR^iSTikartaa. An ever-cycling disc called sudarshana-chakra is handled symbolising his ever-lasting dynamism. He is the maintainer of that continuous dynamism of already created Universe sthiti-kartaa. A mace called kaumodakii for bludgeoning enemies as he is the eradicator of evil samhaarakartaa, and a conch-shell called paanchajanya which produces the sound of Om, listening to which salvation, mukti, is achieved by the true devotee. The sound of the same conch shell gives out an unbearable sound in respect of enemies. He is entered here without a lotus in hand. That means there is no need for a creation afresh. The other items he is handling are enough to deal with Ravana. If the Lotus is not handled that hand is taken as a blessing hand, abhayahasta. And now he is giving that a+bhaya no fear, an assurance, to all gods.\nThe expression that Vishnu has come on his eagle-vehicle has a cross-reference to the previous chapter's garuDa-yajnavedi , Eagle-shaped Altar of Fire that is laid by priests of Dasharatha. It will be laid so with assumption that Garuda, also called suparNa, the Divine Eagle will fly in to transport oblations. The Vedic ritual is also called suparNa, the golden winged, or great winged vehicle to conduct oblations. And the eagle-vehicle of Vishnu is the quickest carrier of oblations to the deities specified in Vedic hymn. Here this Garuda has already carried the oblations offered by King Dasharatha to the chanting of Vedic hymns by Sage Rishyasringa to Vishnu. So Vishnu is now coming mounted on the same meritorious carrier, namely Garuda. Secondly the simile of Sun's coming mounted on a black cloud has some thing to do with yajna. A silver cloud is no value in giving rains. The rain has got an inseparable combination with Vedic ritual. Since the ritual of Dasharatha is going to fructify the rainfall is due on earth. Hence, the sun on collecting all the merits called the rituals of Dasharatha, in the form waters is coming riding on a black cloud to shower rains. Hence Vishnu and Sun both are ready now shower their graces. Vishnu will shower grace by eradicating the evil called Ravana, and the sun by showering the gratuitous and cooling rains.\n"

Then thinking for a while gave the remaining, i.e., one-eighth portion again to queen Sumitra. Thus, the king distributed the dessert to his wives differently. [1-16-27, 28, 29]\n",
            "comment": "This is a much-discussed distribution by the traditionalists. Adhyaatma Ramayana, a treatise that postulates god-hood to Rama, gives a well-constructed argument about these shares of dessert and the resultant births of the four brothers, viz., Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna, in accordance with these shares. In its simplest terms and as contained in these verses, queen Kausalya got half of the dessert as an Empress, paTTa-mahiSi. Sumitra gets one-fourth in the first round and after a rethink by Dasharatha, she gets another one-eighth portion. Kaikeyi gets only a one-eighth quantity. Thus, Kausalya gives birth to Rama, Sumitra to Lakshmana and Shatrughna, and Kaikeyi to Bharata. The quantum of apportionment of the dessert does not make Rama all-powerful or Bharata the least. Since the Absolute is indivisible into parts, the dessert that is divided is not to be taken as the divided Absolute, but a kind of medium through which the incarnation is made possible.\nThere is another declination enquiring whether the incarnation of Rama is full or partial, puurNa-avatara or ardha-avatara... Rama is Vishnu Himself while Bharata and Shatrughna are his disc and conch-shell, while Lakshmana is the thousand headed snake aadisheSha on whose coils Vishnu reclines. The whole dessert is divine and parts of it do not signify and inter-divided god-hoods. Hence, the apportionment of the desert is done in order to keep up the hierarchy of the queen-hoods and their status. Throughout this magnum opus Rama never said that he is god or an incarnate of god, but called himself, nimitta-maatra a casual relation to the course of events. Should Rama be the incarnation of the Almighty Himself, he has little or no necessity to incarnate the weaponry along with him. They are at his beck and call at any time. Thus, Rama is neither a half nor one-fourth incarnation of the Absolute nor a dividend of the whole, but an incarnate of the virtuously ideal personality of Vishnu, maryaadaa purushottama Rama.\nIncidental to this apportionment of the dessert, the aspect of eldest son is also studied. Rama is the first-born and thus the eldest. This is because the dessert is given to queen Kausalya in the first instance, and half of the whole vessel. She immediately consumed to lionise her share and as an Empress. Sumitra waited a while till apportionment is complete. Kaikeyi got her portion but waited till her elder sister Sumitra completes her drink. In the meanwhile Dasharatha thought a while, as said in the verse, and gave Sumitra another one-eighth part. Sumitra then consumed her two parts. Later Kaikeyi drinks her dividend.\n"

In 14th verse, the pronoun aham, 'I' used by Sage Vishvamitra is to announce definiteness about his own stature to know the Absolute vis-a-vis the Absolute Himself. Vishvamitra was an emperor who left off everything. He was primarily a raajarShi, kingly sage, later became brahmarShi and performed mokShakaameSTi. That is a highest ascesis for achieving salvation. Whereas Dasharatha performed Vedic ritual called putrakaameSTi, ritual for begetting sons, as he is still involved in earthly passions. Thus he is still in karmic cycle and recently went under the veil of moha, worldly delusion, advent to the birth of sons. So Dasharatha cannot know who Rama is. All these aspects are said to qualify that expression aham, i.e., 'I am', as said by Vishvamitra.\nHe also says aham vedmi , it is not just 'I know' but 'I am in full knowledge of Rama' and it is immediately followed by mahaatmaanam, about the sublime soul Rama. Rama is at present a twelve-year lad, and Dasharatha should have enquired how a boy is said to be a sublime-soul. Dasharatha did not bother to enquire about the high souled property of his son, because of his newfound fondness for sons. But, Vishvamitra is in full knowledge as to who Rama is, and says Rama is a sublime-soul, as contained in scripture puruSasuukta which says vedaahametam puruSam mahaantam, and as in yo maam pashyati sarvatra....sa ca Me na praNasyati Bhagavad Gita, 6-30, as well.\nIn next foot at 15th verse, Vishvamitra argues that he is not just extolling Rama to achieve his personal purpose, i.e., the completion of ritual. He says, vashiSTho api even Sage Vashishta, knows Rama. Here the word api , even, is said to have been used to qualify Vashishta as an antagonist of Vishvamitra in policy differences. 'Even my opponent, this Sage Vashishta, the descendent of Goddess Saraswati and Brahma, and a brahmarSi, Absolute-knower, and at whose instance I became a brahmarSi from raajarSi , is aware of Rama...' is the argument of Vishvamitra, stressing his neutrality in seeking Rama's help.\nStill Vishvamitra tells that ye cheme tapasi sthitaaH , 'those sages that are here who are rooted in ascesis' as in the vein of puruSasuukta which says tasya dhiiraaH pratijaananti yonim. Vishvamitra's argument is 'Sage Vashishta may take sides with you, because he is rajaguru , the royal priest, while the others like Kaashyapa, Vaamadeva will tell you clearly, as they have no leaning on your court.'\nAll said and done, King Dasharatha is still lingering for a reply. Seeing that Vishvamitra further says, 'if you want to achieve renown, send Rama.' No father rejoices that much when a son is birthed than on his achieving reputation. Dasharatha is advised in the same way when saying yadi dharmalaabham, yasho laabham 'if you want renown through a worthy son, who will be renowned in all three worlds by his coming with me, then you send Rama...'\nNow Rama's reputation is going to be enhanced by Sage Vishvamitra in eliminating demoness Tataka, in releasing Ahalya from her curse, breaking Shiva's bow, marriage with Seetha, rebuffing Parashuraama etc. And also Vishvamitra leaves the decision to Dasharatha, 'if only your ministers, clergy as well political, permit then alone you send Rama with me...'\n"

And this is confirmed by Mareecha while advising Ravana, that 'as a boy of twelve Rama, killed my mother and brother, and hit me out' as at 3-38-6, uunadvaadashavarSaH Or, baalo dvaadashavarSo ayam as per other versions of the same verse.\nRamayana has some bearing on the number twelve. The Books or Kaanda-s are 6, half of twelve. The total verses are 24 thousand, two folds of twelve thousand. Rama is born in twelfth month. Vishvamitra's arrival, or better said as Seethaa-kalyaaNa , Seetha's marriage with Rama, is in the twelfth year. His stay in Ayodhya before crown prince ceremony and exile is for twelve years. The years of Rama's exile are twelve, plus two years stay in Panchavati, of the total fourteen years of exile. In Uttara Ramayana Seetha's exile in the hermitage of Valmiki is for twelve years. So on...\nSome others said that because Rama has not yet attained all the sixteen phases like full moon, he is not a full-fledged person, chaaru SoDashakalaasahitaH Again in saying: raajiivalochana lotus-eyed one - petals of lotuses close down by night, so Rama's eyelids too close by night for a boyish sleep. Then how can such a boy war with night-active demons? In answer to this Sage Vishvamitra uses the same wording in previous chapter at 1-19-18, dasharaatram; raamam raajiivalocanam where the wording raajiivalocana is used by Vishvamitra in the sense that the petals of a lotus spread out on the first rays of sun. So also the very opening of the lotus-petal eyelids of Rama will eradicate the nightly menace of demons with his Omniscient Sun-Moon-Fire eyes, suuryachandraagnilochanaH , that can see even in night.\nA Kshatriya of sixteen years age is unfit to war with any one, as he is still a childhood baalaH aaSoDashaavarSaH . But Rama is under sixteen, and he is being requisitioned for war. Can he combat even if he is under aged? Yes, he can, says Govindaraja as per the nyaya /syndrome, tejasaam hi na vayaH samiikShyate 'dextrous person's age is not to be reckoned' As such, though Rama appears to be under aged he can do wonders in eliminating the vice. This is again rounded off with Vishvamitra's wording in last chapter: aham vedmi mahaatmaanam raamam raajiivalocanam.\n"

            "comment": "The epithets used in epic may be on the increase from now, and they may not be construed as redundant foot fillers. All have implicit meanings and they can be understood with the help of commentaries. As this work cannot include voluminous commentaries, many of the meanings of epithets as said by commentators are not incorporated. This bypassing will not effect the ordinary narration. For e.g., the meaning to the words munipungava, narashaarduula will be 'the eminent saint' 'tigerly man'. And trying to obtain a squeezed meaning from them would be futile, without resorting to some commentary. So also, there are words like indra, candra, simha, shaarduula, naaga, vR^iSabha, pungava which when suffixed to vocatives will mean 'best, choicest, excellent' etc., as per simha-shaarduula-naagaadyaaH pumsi shreSTaarthagocharaaH . But commentators have explained why that character is 'best or excellent, or a lion' at that juncture. For e.g., dharmaatmaathe apparently usual epithet in Ramayana has many meanings like – 1] one whose life is dharma; 2] one whose body is dharma incarnate; 3] one whose soul is filled with dharma; 4] one whose entity itself is dharma – so on, basing on the thesaurus of aatmathat say as: aatmaa yatna-dhR^iti-svaanta-svabhaava-paramaatmaasu jiiva-buddhi- shariireSu..\nSo also, more than often Seetha will be referred as Vaidehi or Maithili in Aranya Kanda. Some details about it are incorporated in that book. Wherever possible those niceties will be included subject to availability of commentaries, which commentaries have already became 'the flowers in the sky.'\nHence, without trying to squeeze meaningless meanings, and leaving this aspect to pundits and researchers, and as this work cannot be stuffed with those intricacies, henceforth the meanings of epithets are said simply, and at times ignored also. This may please be kept in view while reading.\n",

Though known to be Vishnu in this incarnation, without deviating from his vow of according charities in 'as is where is condition', Bali accords that much space to the boy. Then Vaamna places one dwarfish foot on this globe and the entire globe is covered with it. Vaamna then asks Bali where to put the second foot. Bali shows heavenward, which heavenly worlds are conquered by Bali and are under his control at that time. Vaamana places his second dwarfish foot on all the heavenly worlds covering all of them. Then again, Vaamana asks Bali as to where the third foot-space is. Bali shows his head to place the third foot. Vaamana places his foot on this third foot-space, i.e., on Bali's head and starts to trample him to paataala-loka, nether worlds. At the time of donating the charity, while Bali is pouring water oblation into the hands of Vaamana, Sage Shukraachaarya, the demon's high priest, knowing this dwarf boy to be Vishnu, enters the nozzle of the water pot so that the donation water may not fall into the hands of the boy, thus to fail the donation. Knowing that the sage is in the nozzle of the water-pot, Vaamana pierces the nozzle with a straw of darbha, sacred grass-blade, thus piercing one eye of Sage Shukraachaarya. From then on, this sage has become one-eyed sage, symbolically meaning that he eyes on one side only, namely on the side of demon's welfare. Vaamana places his third step on the head of Emperor Bali and subjugates him to netherworlds, freeing the other worlds from his rule. However, Vishnu blesses Bali to be deathless, though subdued into netherworlds, and to become Indra in the coming manvantara-s, eras.

[1-44-22b, 23]\n",
            "comment": "Almost every puraaNa, mythological treatise, deals with the sanctity of Ganga. It is therefore queried and counter-queried as to why and how she is sanctifying. Many treatises have detailed about it. This river emerges from the nail of the left foot's big-toe of Vishnu as said in Vishnu Puraana: gangaa devaanganaa angaanaam anulepanaa api pinjaraa | vaamapaadaambujaanguShTanakhasroto vinirgataa | visNorbhibharti yaam bhaktyaa shirasaa aharnisham dhR^ivam - sivaH Hence she took landing on Shiva's head. shankarasya shirasi bhraShTam patitam kalmaShaapahaa - maheshvara tiirtha 'the one who plunged onto Shankara's head and the very same is the remover of sins.'\nEven if that river has fallen onto the head of Shiva at a later time, her original birth place is at the feet of Vishnu hence that river is sacred. After falling on the head of Shiva she is released and she rapidly flowed onto earth. Hence, her speed and rapidity alone are the sanctifying factors. nadii vegena shudhyati - govinda raaja 'a river cleanses itself by its rapidity.' As such, after incarceration by Shiva she flowed rapidly and thus her sanctity is kept up, by her very rapidity.\nOn bearing these sanctifying waters on his head, Shiva became a sanctified Shiva as said at sarit praparodakena tiirthena - candramaulividhR^itena shivaH shivo aabhuut - bhaagavatapuraaNa. Shiva presumed that he is honoured for the falling of Ganga on his head as said at tat ambupatitam dR^iShTvaa dadhaara shirasaa haraH | paavanaartham jaTaamadhye - mahaa bhaarata Even in aadhyaatma raaamayaNa Sage Vashishta says to Vishnu tvat paadasalilam dhR^itvaa dhanyo bhuut girijaapatiH - aadhyaatma raamaayaNa 'on bearing your foot's waters Shiva became pious.'\nIn the legend of Trivikrama, dwarf-ascetic-boy, at one place it is said that due to the pressure of the foot of Vamana, the incarnation of Vishnu, the shell of the universe is pierced and water available outside has gone in and that water belonged to the Divine Ganga. At another place it is said when Brahma washed the feet of Vishnu that water from his kamanDulu'handy vessel' flowed as Ganga. Still at another place it is said that the dharmaitself flowed as Ganga at the behest of Brahma. These three are correlated and said that 'when Brahma washed the feet of Vishnu the waters were not sufficient enough to drench, then Brahma ordered dharmato flow like water, but that too was not enough, and when Vamana pierced the shell of universe then dharmaflowed as Ganga.\nThe yoga takes yet another viewpoint of Ganga. Their great guru is Shiva, and hence yogis say that every fraction of second Ganga, or cetana, vitality, flows in ones own body. tat paadapadmajam ga~Ngaam nipatantiim svamuurdhani | cintayet brahmarandhreNa pravishantiim svakaam tanuum | tayaa sa~NkShaalayet deham baahyam abhyantaram malam | tat kShaNaat virajo mantra jaayate sphaTikopamam ||According to the six-plexus theory cetana shakti, power of vitality, flows through brahma randhra'the hole in the mid of the pate' to sahasrakamalathe multi-petal-lotus, the Internal Capsule or the Reticular Activating System and from there to aaj~naa cakra' plexus of discrimination' back at the third eye, and from there the vitality flows down the lines of the three spinal nerves, viz., iDaa, pingala, suSumnasympathetic, parasympathetic and central spinal cord. These three are the three replicas of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. Their confluence occurs once at aaj~naa cakra' third eye' and again at the perineum and having gone to the perineum this Ganga activates the dormant particles of vitality to raise them up the spinal system. Thus, the Supreme Yogi Shiva ordains the vitality called Ganga to flow up and down the plexuses, from grey matter down to the perineum, only to activate the system. More Information than this will become unjustifiable here.\nGanga is ever holy because she does not have any womanly stigmas. dvimaasam saritah sarvaa bhavanti rajasvalaaH - maarkanDeya - - simhakarkaaTakayoH madhye sarvaa nadyaa rajasvalaaH - vyaaghrapaada 'for two months all the rivers menstruate' Maarkandeya Puraana. 'When sun in Leo-Cancer all rivers menstruate.' that is due to monsoon and new waters, as such bathing in them at that time is prohibitive. But River Ganga perennially draws its river water from Himalayas thus she has no such blemish.\nFor all these diverse opinions the reply is given in Ramayana itself as said in Ayodhya vishNupaadodbhavaam divyaam - ayodhyaand also at 1-43-7 of Ramayana saa tasmin puNyaa - puNye rudrasya muurdhani - raamaayaNawhich imports the meaning: 'she that pious River Ganga, fell onto the pious head of Shiva,' i.e., 'without any mutation, both Shiva and Ganga are the sanctifiers by themselves, while helping each other, i.e., Shiva helped Ganga to gain a foothold on His head, while Ganga helped Shiva to become the root cause to bear and release her brunt, and in turn, both of them helped the humankind.' Thus, what more can be sanctity than helping the created beings with one's own dharma.\n",

The churning rod is the spinal cord in the rod like backbone and the churning strings are the ida, pingala namely, the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The churners are the air elements of vital forces on either side. This total system is held upright by Vishnu because He is naaraayaNa, nara + aayaNa 'one who conducts humans, say created beings, into being and lead them away, again into His own self...' When kundalini power is incited the first results are always negative like, haalaaha, 'the lethal poison...' and all all-ruinous ills befall on us. If this negativity is surrendered to someone who can handle it effortlessly, like Shiva, then the positivity results like Amrita/Ambrosia. Even if this elixir of life is readily available, there will be still better lures, lusts, and longings like Mohini and if enchanted by those instantaneous quirks, which are yet another kind of negativity, we will be lost completely, like the demons. Hence 'churn the correct way...' is the postulate of yoga.\n",

Vishvamitra is giving a 'rehearsal' for these brothers for their real forest trekking later in the legend.

He functions as a CEO of the universe, maintaining seasons, rains, thunders, thunderbolts, crops, earthquakes, and every aspect of nature, whether they are good or bad for us. If any Vedic-ritual were performed, this Indra would be too happy, as he and his deputies like Rain-god, Fire-god, Air-god, et al., will receive many oblations from that ritual. But if it is tapas 'the practise of asceticism, penance, or ascesis' by single sage, Indra will be highly perturbed. Usually sages will be practising this ascesis for attainment of higher abodes of Brahma, Vishnu, or Shiva. Some practise this to overthrow present Indra and try ascending to his position, or to attain immortality and thereby rout out Indra, as with the case of Ravana. When that practise is about to materialise, Indra sends his agents, like voluptuous celestial beauties, namely the apsara-s, to infatuate those sages with their beauty. Once the sage's concentration fails, his practise becomes futile. Thus, Indra retains his present position. Here, though Sage Gautama did not practise his ascesis for Indra's post, Indra had to hinder it in his own apprehension, and when the fury of Gautama is incited, Gautama's practise also failed and he had to redo his ascesis until he overcomes his passions. Thus, this 'causing hindrance' is a divine-act as proclaimed by Indra to other gods. In doing such 'divine-acts' Indra will also be maligned, for which the higher gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, or other higher beings will come to his rescue.\n"

There are many other instances in relating these mythical accounts of Ramayana to the earthly plane. Another instance is lavaNaasurasamhaara elimination of Saline Demon...' and Rama's elimination of this demon is taken as treatment of saline oceanic water as potable waters...'\nWhen the mythology is touched upon, it says that Ahalya is lying there as a stone and by the touch of Rama's foot she regained her divinely human form. This is not evident in Valmiki Ramayana. The idea of petrifaction of Ahalya is brought in from PadmaPuraana which says: saa tataH tasya raamasya paadasparshanaat mahaatmanaH | abhuut suruupaa vanitaa samaakraantaa mahaashilaa || by the touch of the feet of that great souled Rama, she was manifest as a divine damsel, getting rid of her stone-shape...' Further, there will be an exchange of words between Indra and Brahma in Uttara Kanda of Ramayana, and there this episode of Ahalya recurs. At that place Brahma defines hala as - distorted shape...' and a halya is one with an impeccable beauty...' Besides the above, Indra will be usually addressed as sahasraakSha - thousand eyed one...' and behind this legend, there is another legend, saying that Gautama's curse to Indra is: since you delighted with Divine Ahalya, who is crafted by Brahma, in carnal pleasures, let there be thousand carnally vaginal apertures on your body...' Then that Indra is agitated for such an appearance, pleads for mercy. Then, the curse is amended saying 'instead of vaginal apertures, the apertures on your body will look like eyes...' thus Indra became sahasraakSha.\nF. Max Muller records in his History of Sanskrit Literature' the commentary of Kumaarila Bhatt, yet another ancient commentator on Ramayana. \"In the same manner, if it is said the Indra was the seducer of Ahalya. This does not imply that the God Indra committed such a crime, but Indra means the Sun and Ahalya the night, from [the words] ahaH the 'day' and lil the 'night'; and as the night is seduced and ruined by the sun of the morning, there is Indra called the paramour of Ahalya.\"\nDharmaakuutam views this as paatityam, patita falling from practise of virtuousness' Such women are said to be accepted by men after making their amends for their faults. tathaa svaruupanaasham kR^itvaa vaayubhakSha ityaadi vayonuurpashaapapradaanena caapalyaat satkR^itaparapuruShavR^ittaa striiniyamena shocayitvaa punaH sa~Ngrahya iti suucitam | abhyaase tu paatityam | - tathaa ca gautamaH - ninditakarmaabhyaasi patitaat tyaagapatitaat tyaaginaH patitaaH - iti - dk\n"

Thus, Vashishta's only weapon is Gayatri hymn with which he subjugated all the arsenal of Vishvamitra. The fight between Vishvamitra and Vashishta is not just a fight between a sage and king, but between vidya - avidya; aatmavidya - anaatmavidya 'enlightenment and un-enlightenment...' An enlightened one does not spring up at any trivial inconvenience but becomes a horrid being, if that antagonistic assail becomes intolerable for living beings. This is the real essence and nature of a true Brahman, whose arsenal is just a wooden baton and heartfelt Gayatri hymn.\nFor this Bhagavad Gita says at Ch. 18, verse 42:\n'A Brahman's virtues, / Prince Born of his nature, are serenity / Self-mastery, religion, purity / Patience, uprightness, learning, and to know / The truth of things which be...'

The nomenclature of caNDaal is not the present day 'untouchable' 'outcaste' or a 'pariah' etc., because he is also a member and an important functionary in Hindu system of castes. In Aranya Kanda Seetha admonishes Ravana with the same wording at 3-56-18. The analogy she uses there is to differentiate between functionaries like the Vedic-scholar and the caste-bound Profaner [meaning: one who is not initiated into religious rites or any esoteric knowledge... but socially designated as a Cremator] and between the Altar of Fire and Fire of Pyre, and between the Vedic Ritual and Funeral Rites, both involving Vedic-hymns. A Vedic scholar, or a true Brahmin may perhaps conduct a yaj~na but he is no authority to conduct antyakriya 'funerals' till its end. At best, a priest's function is until the lighting of the pyre, and even perhaps until kapaalamoksha 'breakage of cranium...' and from then on it is the function of this caNDaal to take care of the corpse consigned to fire and for its complete cremation, since leaving half burnt corpse to vultures and wolves is sinning as well as for unsanitary situations. Thus, if a Vedic scholar conducts jaataadi kriyaaH 'rites from birth onwards...' as an initiator, then a caNDaal conducts antya, uttarakriyaaH 'rites of death afterwards...' as a terminator. This verbiage is to demark the relative values of functionaries, according to the maxim 'a donkey is to bear and a dog is to bark...' and if their functions are reversed, reversed are our results.\n"

When his father was exiling him, Trishanku took umbrage at Vashishta, because Vashishta did not come to his rescue. The second blemish is due to the killing Vashishta's milch cow, knowingly. Trishanku kills that cow, when he did not get any food for the day to feed the son of Vishvamitra. At that time, he had to protect the wife and three sons of Vishvamitra, as Vishvamitra has gone away to a distant place for his ascesis, leaving his kingdom and family. Then Trishanku comes to the rescue of his family. With that gratitude, now Vishvamitra tries to requite this king in sending him to heaven. The third damnation is for his usage of unsanctified meat of his kill. Thus, Trishanku is the one who carries 'three social blemishes' on his head, and added to these is the curse of Vashishta, in making him as a profaner.\nFurther, a god or teacher cannot be dragged to one's side or his wishful thinking, but they are to be attained or appeased with constant faith and servitude. guroH aliikanirbandho na kartavyaH kadaacana | anumaanya prasaaH ca gurukruddho yudhiShTara | shiShyo gurau narashreShTa pratikuulam na sa~ncaret | viShNu puraaNa And if god created the cosmos, a man trying to duplicating it, is as good as going against that writ of that god. Vishvamitra no doubt built many space stations and started cloning gods, leave alone earthly species, but he is forestalled, because he wanted to break the system from within, in which he is and by which he mastered all this expertise. It is as good as cutting the branch of a tree on which he is sitting. Absolute insolence is absolutely condemnable. Hence, Trishanku is still dangling upside down in his so-called heaven.\n",

            "comment": "In the endnote of Ch. 56 of Aranya Kanda, some details are given about the enigmatic Seetha. Here also some points about her enigmatic birth are presented.\nSeetha is considered to be the nature's nature, Primordeal Nature, mahaa-prakriti, and when the five elements of nature intermingle into one, that is the Manifest Nature, where the five elements are pridhvi, aapa, teja, vaayu, aakaasha 'earth, waters, fire, air and space...' and there are many theories of their commingling like, panchiikaraNa, saptiikaraNa quintuplication, and sevenfold commingling etc. The process of creation gives rise to 24 items: 1] empirical or fundamental matter, 2] mahat, 3] ahamkaara, 4-8] five subtle elements, 9-13] five gross elements, 14] mind, 15-19] five sense organs, 20-24] five motor organs, 25] jiivaatma, individual's soul, 26] Brahman, The Absolute. With these, a created living being is created. This is in the case of mortals and their births. But when Seetha is found in the furrow all these things have already happened and there is no question of human pregnancy to be attached to her. Hence Seetha is to be taken as Goddess Lakshmi, who is paraa-shakti, Vishnu-Maayaa and when she has to take an incarnation to become the prime cause to the effect of eliminating Ravana, no human activity of reproduction can be attached to such beings. If she were to be a human, perhaps she would not have exited from the pyre of fire when she self-immolated, after Rama and Ravana war. Some more information, though unrelated to Valmiki Ramayana, is given hereunder.\nLakshmi evolved from the Milky Ocean, when gods and demons churned it for amrita, the Divine Elixir, along with it a host of other items like, haalaahala, [cosmic poison,] candra Moon, kalpa-vrikSha, [Benevolent Divine Tree,] and the medicinal sage-god Dhanvantari holding the golden pot of amrita, have come out as has been explained by Vishvamitra to Rama in this Kanda.\nVishnu is the all-inclusive deity, known as puruSa or mahaa-puruSa... parama aatma Supreme Person, naraayaNa one who peregrinates mortals in and out this mortal world, antaryAmi The In-dweller of all beings, and He is the sheShin the Totality, in whom all souls are contained. He is bhagavat where bhaga, derives from the root bhaj meaning Gracious Lord, and vat one who has it. Vishnu possesses six such divine glories SaD-guna- vibhuuti, namely, 1] j~naana, Omniscience 2] aishwarya, Providence, 3] shakti, Omnicompetence, 4] bala, Omnipotence, 5] viirya, Immutability. 6] tejas, Resplendence, shakti is the samvit, the Primary Intelligence of God, while the other five attributes emerge from this samvid and hence shakti is the god's ahamata Personality and Activity. Thus this Shakti of god is personified in mythological lore and is called Shri or Lakshmi, and She is said to manifest herself in, 1] kriyaa-shakti, Creative Activity and 2] bhuuti-shakti, Creation of God. Hence Vishnu cannot part with His own personality or creativity i.e., ahamta, which in its feminine form is called shrii or Lakshmi. He therefore needs His consort Goddess Lakshmi to be with Him always, untouched by any. Thus, Goddess Lakshmi has to accompany Vishnu in all His incarnations, along with other paraphernalia like his conch-shell, his quoit and mace, and the thousand headed serpent aadisheSa etc. Such a delightful deity Goddess Lakshmi is a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, but she is fickle like ripples lakShmii hi toyatarangacapalaa Lakshmi= Goddess Lakshmi; hi= indeed; toya= water; taranga= wave like; capalaa= wavering. 'Goddess Lakshmi is wavering like the waves of water...' chapala, chanchala, asthira, wavering, faltering, unstable, and maayaa, maa + yaa 'whose illusory play she is, or liilaa play of god. She comes in unnoticeably like the water in a coconut and evaporates innocently into thin air, at Her will. Such as she is she is easily grabbed by the greedy. Hence none can give birth to her except the Mother Nature, and hence she is called mahilaa ; mahi + laa where mahi is earth and laa ; laH khaNDane triSu aadaane stri because Mother Earth gave birth to Seetha, Seetha is mahilaa Hence it is better to avoid assuming her to be an ordinary lady of an ordinary birth, and she may be viewed either legendarily or mythologically, for Valmiki as an epical poet, himself has not chronicled the details of her birth.\nEven Vishnu is deprived of Her in His incarnations, not only in Ramayana but also in His nR^isimha Man-Lion incarnation. There, Maya Lakshmi becomes a tribal woman to bring back the ferocious Lion-Man to his original form. And in other versions of Ramayana, it is said that Ravana abducted Maya Seetha, but not real Seetha. 'When the real Seetha herself is an enigma, what if Ravana abducts real or duplicate copy of that Seetha...' is the brushed aside adjustment. In either case, it is maayaa, liilaa illusory power, sport of Vishnu together with that of Goddess Lakshmi, cause this enigma. Hence, whenever She is thus absconding from Him, Vishnu searches and retrieves Her, for no one in Universe can handle her, nor amass all the wealth. The predestined wealth alone is enjoyable but nothing more can be amassed. So also are the riches in the present day world, come too suddenly and vanish that suddenly. No one is rich ever and anon, and on someday every one is likely to see the ups and downs in his graph of riches. It is Vishnu that retrives the real wealth back to His abode VaikunTha, and even punishes anyone for his accumulation of beyond-the-means-wealth. The burning of Lanka by Hanuma in Sundara Kanda is an example to this.\nIn Lakshmi-tantra , a Vaishnavaite aagama text, She that unrestrainable Goddess Lakshmi declares Herself, as naaraayaNii, vaiSNavii i.e., a coequal of Vishnu, in the play of the universe i.e., in God's liilaa, saying that: aham naaraayaNii naama saa sattaa vaiShNavii paraa 'I am indeed naaraayaNii i.e. Lakshmi, the Supreme Essence of Vishnu... [Lakshmi Tantra 3.1.]\nThe Hindu mythology bases more on its eighteen Puraana-s, each of the six is rendered to each of the Hindu Trinity, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. A] Vishnu Puraana-s are: - 1] Vishnu, 2] bhaagavata, 3] naaradiiya, 4] garuda, 5] padma. 6] varaaha. B] Brahma Puraana-s : -1] Brahma, 2] brahmaanda, 3] brahmavaivarta, 4] maarkandeya, 5] bhaviSya,6] vaamana. C] Shiva Puraana-s : - 1] vaayu, 2] linga, 3] skanda, 4] agni, 5] matsya, 6] kuurma. In all these Puraana-s Goddess Lakshmi is given a laudable place without any sectarian dispute. In the Vaishnavaite Puraana-s, Shiva starts telling the efficacy of Vishnu to Goddess Parvati. While Shaiva mythology places Goddess Parvati, the consort of Shiva, in one half of Shiva's body ardhanaariishvara-tattva, and Vaishnavaite tradition places Goddess Lakshmi in the heart of Vishnu itself, as if it is a Lotus hridayakamala. This is to depict the inseparable unison of Universal puruSa, Male and prakriti , Female, the seed and field.\nWhile Valmiki Ramayana names Rama as Rama, the Padma Puraana etc., mythological texts bring in the Vedic texts and prefix shrii of shrii-suukta of Rig Veda khila 5-87, which is a feminine counterpart of puruSa-suukta of Rig Veda 10-90, for paramapuruSa i.e., Vishnu or Narayana, and thus call Rama of Valmiki as shrii raama. Vaishnavaite mythologies take hold of these and other Vedic references to Vishnu, and treat Vishnu / Narayana and Lakshmi as the inseparable divine couple, who maintain this Universe. The prefix shrii means as 'one who takes delight in shrii i.e., Lakshmi, meaning wealth, wealth of any kind. shriiriti prathamam naama lakshmyaaH and ' if a is the first name of Vishnu, shrii is the first name of Lakshmi. Thus, primarily eight kinds of wealth are established, to be associated with Goddess Lakshmi. They are 1] aadi Lakshmi Wealth a priori 2] dhaanya Lakshmi Cereal Wealth 3] Dhairya Lakshmi Wealth of Courage 4] gaja Laksmi Elephant Wealth, i.e., Elephantine Wealth of all animals and livestock, santaana Lakshmi Wealth of Progeny, 6] vijaya Lakshmi, Wealth of Victory, 7] vidyaa Lakshmi Wealth of Education, 8] dhana Lakshmi Monetary Wealth. And any thing that need be affluent gets the auspicious prefix shrii or suffix lakshmi, and called raajya Lakshmi , Wealth of Empire, bhaagya lakshmi Wealth of Fortune, and the like...\nThe play of Goddess Lakshmi in the form of Seetha is Ramayana. As such, her absence from Rama caused Rama to travel up to Lanka, annihilate the evil, and retrieve her. Seetha herself expresses her anguish about Rama's indulgence in a Supreme welfare-state, than in herself, as Mahaakavi Kalidasa, in his epical poem Raghu Vamsha, and depicts what this bhaagya lakshmi has to say, when Rama, basing on some satirical remarks of his lowly subject, deserts Seetha in favour of raajya lakshmi when Seetha said as below:\n\"Earlier you refused the kingdom-wealth, raajya lakshmi and came to forests, where I was with you. Now that, that kingdom-wealth, raajya lakshmi on winning your affection is jealous of me, who am your bhaagya lakshmi 'fortune-wealth...' and she does not let me live in your palace.\" And thus, Seetha departs Rama to forests, at the fag end of Ramayana.\nValmiki declares Ramayana is siithaayaaH charitam mahaan... 'Seetha's impeccable conduct...' by giving her an unusual birth from the furrow of the plough, and in the end she exits from this world into the same soil, where the earth is called vasundharaa, which cleaves under Seetha's feet, and takes Seetha into her womb again. As such, the reason for Seetha to be there in that furrow as baby is said to be a vow of Goddess Lakshmi, in her earlier incarnation as Vedavati. The mythologies go on to say that Vedavati is the brainchild of a sage called Kushadhwaja, and he decides to give Vedavati in marriage none less than Vishnu. But in his lifetime, it is an unfulfilled desire. Then Vedavati starts a rigorous penance to achieve her father's wish. When she is at her culmination point of her penance, Ravana, passing that way in sky sees this beautiful lady, nears, and disturbs her penance. Vedavati coming out of her meditation, curses Ravana saying that she will reincarnate herself, to destroy Ravana and his entire dynasty. Then she causes a yogic fire and immolates herself in it. And Vedavati is reborn as Seetha of Ramayana, in an unusual way.\nHere aananda-raamaayaNa has an interesting parable. Once there was a king named Padmaaksha who wanted Lakshmi as his daughter. On practising ascesis Vishnu appears and gives a fruit called maatulunga phala, and girl emerges from out of that fruit, and she is named as Padma. But greedy to possess her, all the wooing kings war with Padmaaksha and his entire family is ruined and Padma jumps into fire and self immolates herself. Later when Vishnu's maayaa comes out of an altar of fire, sits in her meditation, Ravana sees her and wants to abduct her. Of course, she is otherwise said to be Vedavati in other texts. But again, she enters the fire altar and reduces herself to ashes. Even then, Ravana searches in those ashes for her. In there, he gets five diamonds of high quality. He comes to Lanka and paces those diamonds in a casket and jovially presents them to his wife Mandodari. When Mandodari could not lift the casket Ravana lifts it and opens its lid, as he lifted Mt. Kailash. When the casket is opened, Mandodari finds a baby girl in it and recognises her to be Goddess Lakshmi. Then they consult their teachers about that baby's arrival. Those teachers wishing good for Ravana, advise to get rid off this girl immediately, for he is Goddess Lakshmi, arrived here only to end Ravana and his dynasty. Then Mandodari orders his servants to carry away this baby in a casket by an aircraft and get rid off it.\nBut Ravana rushes after the girl with a sword, to put that girl to sword. Empress Mandodari pacifies Ravana and says \"Why purchase a later time death now itself at the hand of this baby... let that the casket be buried...\" Ravana agrees. Mandodari also curses this girl saying, \"this faithless girl, [for wealth is unfaithful,] will thrive only in a house, where the householder has his senses conquered, and who being an emperor lives like a perfect hermit, and who though wealthy and supreme by himself, will care nothing for the riches but view whole of the world and people as his own soul, with an impartial attitude...\" Thus this casket is buried in the fields of King Janaka's empire by demons, clandestinely. Mandodari thought that such a person is an impossibility to take birth in this mortal world, to foster this buried girl, and thus presumed her curse to be twisty. But there is King Janaka with all the above attributes. A king without ego, wealthy but living simple, childless, yet does not crave for one, like King Dasharatha. Hence, he is called raajarSi a saintly king. Seetha's birth is to be limitedly understood, as said by Janaka in this chapter. Otherwise, the nuances about the birth of Seetha are to be viewed through the viewfinders of mythologies, legends, and above all, through the viewfinders of tradition... but not in the vast of epical poetry, as Valmiki himself has undocumented it...\n",

Four aratni-s cubits are one dhanu, a bow-length, where one aratni is 18 inches, thus a bow-length is 6 feet and above, taking the standard size of archer as a six-footer and a little above. The bow's height is the height of the archer plus one measure of his head's height, as the upper end has to tower the archer's head. That being so, this bow belongs to Shiva and its height must be placed more than the human measure of 6 feet, and then it must be some 8 to 10 feet. And 'Rama is no crane-legged boy, as hisphysique is said to be of 'medium' size, and then how a boy of, say of 4, 41/2 feet, could catch the upper end of 8-10 feet bow to bend it...' is the objection. An archer has to stand the bow on ground, clutch its lower end under big toe, and with one hand, he has to bend it, while with the other he catches the bowstring to string the other end. He is not supposed to handle it like a holdall or a briefcase. For this objection it is said in a way that the poet is using the adjective mahaatmaa to Rama, ' an unfathomable one with an equally unfathomable soul... inasmuch as his duty is concerned...' The minute he touched the bow, it became a spongy stick and it listened to him and bent as he wished. Other way round, Rama is an ambidextrous archer and furthered is his skill by his possession of some divine missiles as given by Vishvamitra. Hence, his dexterity is now multiplied and he can handle any divine or human bow 'effortlessly...'\n"

Here it is Shiva's bow and name of Shiva and all letters that attaches to Him are shaM, sha.nkara, shaMbhava, are peace-making letters, as codified in AUM namaH shambhave ca mayo bhave ca namaH sha~Nkaraaya ca mayaskaraaya ca namaH shivaaya ca shivataraaya ca | - rudram - soma suukta - yajur  Hence the real sound of Om is audible and it is ear-splitting for ordinary audience, since ordinary people cannot possibly face realities, and it is a regularly audible sound for the other four who have not swooned. By the way, it will be impossible for us to listen the chanting of Veda-s, even in these days, in any Vedic school for at least half an hour, as our ears are untuned to their ghana paaTha or jaTa or other sorts of chanting. We feel stranded in some audio studio with fully loaded sound FX.\nAnd the pacemaker Rama lifted the bow of the peacemaker Shiva, where the bow itself is \"Om\". The legendary Indian bow is composed of three parts, unlike Robin Hood's single-piece bow. The lower bowing part, upper bowing part combined by a grip handle, and the bowstring. The three pieces are comparable to the three letters syllabified \"Om\" - a u ma, where a is upper bowing piece of bow, u, the lower end, and ma, the bowstring. The painters usually paint this bow-breaking scene, where Rama will be still handling the upper end in his hand, while the lower part will be falling, and the bowstring will be still dangling onto the upper end. The upper part of bow is a and this a is Vishnu akaaraartho viSNuH, and the dangling bowstring is ma Goddess Lakshmi, lokamaataa maa ramaa mangaladevataa, dangling on the Supreme Person through thick and thin, and the detached-un-detached lower end is u, Lakshmana, or any other adherer. A lengthy account of this trilogy is provided in Aranya Kanda, Ch. 19, first verse.\nAnd the pacemaker Rama is marrying the world with peace, by stringing the bowstring of peacemaker's bow, and it is not a mere marriage of some prince charming, with a charmy princess. Thus, this sound is the initial impact, impetus, brunt, or whatever, for universal peace, and that way this marriage attains a legendary significance in peace process, though by force.\n"

But, to the grammarians, prosodists, aestheticians, and the like, they are a head-breaking headache. A lot of verbal warfare is concurrently going on, perhaps even now, as to which belongs to which expression. To cite an example, here the verse 1-69-18 uses just raaghavau 'a pair of Raghava-s...' for Rama and Lakshmana, and it is no uncommon term to them. But, here this word suddenly assumes a different dimension and aestheticians say that word means 'the pair of brothers who are the decorations, embellishments, and the like, of Raghu's dynasty....' because they dared the bow of Shiva to the extent of its breakage, and by their bold feat they are victorious medallists. While the ancestors in Raghu-s dynasty are pro-gods in seeking Ganga to come to earth etc., this boy Rama has gone against that God, in breaking Shiva's bow. Gita Press' English version puts this as 'the ornaments of Raghu's race...' and R. C. Dutt's poetic version has 'Honoured by the saintly Janak, greeted by his children bold / where the 'boldness' is as explained above. And this 'ornaments' or 'bold boys' or 'medallists' cannot be found in the verse, lexically.\nThere are many who are baffled and bored at these boring and baffling overused epithets and there are enumerations also, as to how many are increased in Aranya Kanda compared to Ayodhya Kanda etc. In Aranya, for e.g., Seetha is variously called as Janaki, alias Vaidehi, alias Maithili... etc., and this chapter can throw some light, or make a difference between an alias and an epithet, on those that available in Aranya, as those epithets in Aranya bear a link with these few chapters. Even then, it will be inconclusive, as nowhere listed are these epithets or their allusions in their true colour. It is unclear for non-Sanskrit readers, even to vernacular Indians, to know as to how many epithets are truly and correctly translatable, without the assistance of ancient commentaries. Even in those commentaries, there are many epithets that are left out, as those commentators were more bothered to their own tenets like 'Rama is god... Rama is human... Rama is the dharma... Rama is Shiva...' etc., than these epithets. And we are presenting as far as we could muster up information about them. Hence, before the total extinction of Sanskrit grammarians and aestheticians, it is necessary to decode these epithets in Ramayana, thus we humbly feel.\nMore on king and along with verse\nPage transferred by FREE Go FTP\n",

Here it an 'Unprovable' entity since it cannot be proved by pramaaNa-s 'source of knowledge' like pratyakSha, anumaana, tarka, aagama... 'perception, inference, logic, scriptures...' and because Vishnu cannot be deduced by these sources of knowledge, Vishnu Himself becomes the avyakta. And from the viewpoint of mythology, Ramayana has no place for a 'featureless Absolute...' nirguNa- brahma of advaita, because Valmiki's initial questions to Narada include ko guNavaan, and thus He is saguNa-brahma. Hence avyakta or aakaasha, 'minus leeway...' all-pervading...' is Vishnu, the 'Unprovable'.\nThis aakaasha is the often repeated expression in Upanishad-s, telling it to be the aatma, Absolute, abiding in each individual jiivaatma, Individual Soul. aakaasho hi vai naamaruupayoH nirvaahitaaH te yad antaram tad brahma tad amR^itam sa aatmaa - chaandogya - 8-14 | ko he vaaNyatkaH praaNaat ya eSha aakaasha aanando na syaat - taittariiya - 7 anuvaaka | aakaashorarthaantaratvaadivyapadeshaat - 1-3-41 | daharottarebhyaH - 1-3-14 - brahma-suutra ;'who is he to be able to balance himself if this aakaasha is not to be there...' Taittarriya; 'that which makes the names and forms is within you alone as your innermost inner-space, that alone is deathless...' Chaandogya; 'akaasha [is Absolute] because it is proclaimed to be something different etc., [from names and forms yet their revealer...]; 'the small [aakaasha] is Absolute because of subsequent texts [which give ample evidence of it...] Brahma-Sutra. Hence, it is Vishnu.\nOut of the three epithets to Brahma one is 'timeless' because He continues to be in two paraartha-s, say 31, 10, 40, 00, 00, 00, 000 human years, without transmutation, yet He continues further. He is 'changeless' as his faculties or His divine being does not undergo any mutation or metamorphosis. He is 'perishless' during the above period and after, since Vishnu gave rise to Him.

The thread bands tied at the wrists of both the bride and bridegroom is as per wedding time vows, to bring them under the pledge of marriage, until its consummation. Indian marriages are time-oriented and every function has to happen on the appointed hour. Hence, the arrival of bridegrooms is also on an opportune hour, which astrologically brings forth success of that event. But some say that this auspicious hour Vijaya occurs in the early part of the day, where this marriage is occurring in the later part of day, hence this time is to be reckoned as one that acquires some victory later in the epic.\nBrides are not the lone category of people destined to wear jewellery.

Later they are to be kept sacred for some days, watering daily, and then can be implanted in earth, if they survive. There are hosts of shops specialised to sell these items and the shopkeeper firstly asks for information 'for bride's side or for bridegroom's side?' And if we say, 'we are from bride's side' a long-list is presented, [while bridegroom's side will have a shorter list of items,] and then the shopkeeper mercifully asks 'how much is the dowry?' If we say this much or that much, he will present a Victorian model push-close pull-open velvet bag. If we exclaim 'what for is this, priest has not listed this' then he politely says, 'the priests of these days are unaware of customs and the dowry is to be put in that velvet bag and then given, as a royal presentation...' And if we say 'we are drained out by the dowry, wherefrom we give royal presentations...' then he will spew fire on us saying 'you spend so much on dowry, can't you purchase its velvet bag...' and thereafter a sermon follows about the dying Indian culture at the onslaught of westernisation, while he starts throwing the packets of navadhaanya etc., as though he is giving alms to the beggar. Though Janaka has not purchased such a bag of dowry, he has some more problems with this marriage. A discussion on this is there at later part.

            "comment": "By the way, where is this Kausalya? Does Rama enrich her happiness without bringing her to his marriage? We have not heard of her or of other queens or hosts of his other wives, for the last three, four days. Has she come, at all? - Yes, she has come and she is physically present - is the argument of some, basing on Valmiki's style of unrecorded accounts on trivial, or matter of fact scenes. They are implied and implicit. Dasharatha has performed some cow donations, religious functions etc., which he is not supposed to do without his wife at his side. These ladies are implicitly included in the first verse of sixty-ninth chapter: sopaadhyaayaH sabaandhavaH 'with teachers, with relatives...' and Dasharatha has no near relatives, not exactly relatives, but family, other than his queens and sons. So, they all are in 'et cetera... and others' cadre at present. Other way round, it is said in Kshatriya-s only male members will go and get the bride, which has no reasonable or tenable import, as far as marriages are concerned, and where every marriage concerns only with womenfolk and their panoply.\nSeetha is said to have all bridal jewellery, which is not odd or particular to this corner of globe. But it is oddish and exotic jewellery if the bride is from well-to-do family or from royal family. Though not all, some of the jewellery items that are almost extinct now are listed here. siimanta-pralamba a pendant clipped at back of head, dangle through the central parting of head-hair, onto the crown of head, with nine-gem-stud locket; shiroja-suuci diamond studded hair pins on either side of head above ears; naasaabharanam a round nasal ring; naasabhuSaNam single or a pair of nine-gems studded nasal ornament; karNaabharaNa, taaTanka, karNikaa various kinds of earrings with dangling cups, to which trinket bells dangle; shata-yaSTika hundred stringed pearl necklace; anukanThii, muktaavalii, graiveyikam and many other kinds of necklaces; mekhala three finger width golden cincture, studded with nine-gems, and with fine golden chains dangling like festoons; saptakii seven stringed girdle string, where the strings dangle onto hip, with expanding festoons; keyuuram bicep-lets; kankaNam bracelets and bangles from wrist halfway up forearm; maNi-manjiira, tulaa-koTi, paadaangada ankle-let with kinkiNii trinket bell-globules; cuuDaamaNi a circular jewel at bun of hair from which a gold sheet dangles till the end of braid, on which all zodiac signs are engraved. At the top, on the left and right of this cuuDaamaNi ornaments in the shape of sun and moon are pinned into hair, and at the end of braid three / five gold cups studded with hair like strands upakaca will be dangling. This set of braid's ornamentation is said to receive the solar energy to whole of the spine. So goes on and on the list of ornaments, to the delight of the girl wearing them and to the delight of the goldsmith making them.\nHere there are five Raghava-s and only one kausalyaanandavardhana i.e., Rama. Then poet should have simply said 'Rama' instead of 'Raghava' but there are many Rama-s, Parashu Rama, and Bala Rama and suchlike, and on such calling as 'Rama...' Parashu Rama, who is scheduled to enter after marriage, may perhaps enter now, in a faux pas. Then the poet should have said dasharathaatmajam . Then, who will be that single soul from among the four boys of Dasharatha to come forward. And if all the four hear the calling, as 'oh, Raghava' all will reply in chorus \"ok, it is I...\" then what will happen? Avoiding all these irksome situations, the poet gave this stage-direction to Janaka that he should aim at the son of Kausalya, with a subtext, 'you are mothered by some human female, whereas my daughter is motherless, rather un-mothered, ayonijaa non-foetal is her origination, hence it is apt of you to not to belittle her, anytime and anywhere... and you have to keep faith with her, since she outshines in outperforming your task in this so-called incarnation...'\n"

H. Griffith\nThe above is very a convenient and readymade gist of that verse. But the three pronouns in the first stanza iyam, mama, tava 'this, mine, yours' are supposed to play havoc in deciphering the latent meaning of this verse. Let us look at some of them.\nSeetha is very much there in the front of Rama, and Janaka might have shown her and told \"take her...' Why this iyam i.e., \"this\" It is explained as below:\nJanaka: This and this alone is Seetha, the unique, exceptional and earmarked one for you... do not confuse yourself by looking at Urmila, Maandavi and Shrutakiirti they are for your brothers\nRama: Why she alone is earmarked for me?\nJanaka: Because she is 'Seetha '\nRama: What, you mean a furrow, or a sillion...\n[Sillion is an old word for furrow, not found in dictionaries, but used by poet Hopkins in his 'The Windhover' sheer plod makes plough down sillion /]\nJanaka: Yes, everything comes out of earth... from coal to gold, flora to fauna, rivers to ridges everything.... a morsel of food comes from a handful of mud in this mortal world.... your being, becoming and belonging in, are manifest only because of that earth and earth enables you to live on her without seeking any requital or reciprocation and earth is the symbol of enduing toleration, though you dig, dung or dredge it.... hence, Seetha is the symbol for mortal truth, and mortally tolerant womanhood and you people want to know the Unknown in the skies, but do not wish to know what that is right under your feet... vedaaham etam puruSham mahaantam aadityavarNam tamasaH parastaat | if the Supreme Person beyond darkness is knowable, and sages like Vishvamitra know you and tell that you are some Super Soul aham vedmi mahaatmaanam raamam satyaparaakramam - bala 19-14 likewise you shall know iyam siitaa, for she is somebody to match you... have you not mugged up Veda-s, Upanishad-s\nRama: Why not every bit of it...  you name, it I tell it\nJanaka: How does the fifth mantra of eighth topic in Chaandogya Upanishad reads?\nAdi Shankara's commentary: There are three letters that denote the Absolute sa, ta, yam; and the syllable ii on sat is for easy pronunciation. The letter sa indicates immortality and the word ta mortality, and the syllable yam conditions and bridges both the above ' Ramanuja comment: The letter sat is immortality and the letter ti is mortality and yam conditions both, hence sattiyam is indicative of Spiritedness and non-spiritedness ' Madhvaacaarya says: sat, delivered immortal souls; ti yet to be delivered bounded souls; yam both the delivered and bounded souls.\nJanaka: Seetha is that yam the conjunctive, conditioner, bridge between the mortal and immortal, setu - eSa setu iti vidhaaraNaa the presiding deity of cetana-acetana dynamic, static beings. oh, Rama, it is said in Vishnu Puraana that Seetha is your lookalike, minus your sky-blue complexion, raaghavatve bhavet siitaa... It is said in yet another scripture, yathaa mayaa jagat vyaaptam - svaruupeNa svabhaavataH | tayaa vyaaptam idam vishvam niyantrii ca tathaa iishvarii || 'as to how I am all pervading, likewise She, Goddess Lakshmi, is all pervading and the controller of the universe ' and if you want to establish yourself as the protector of this world, you have to take this and this Seetha alone, as she is the cause for the desired effect of yours and, she is from Mother Earth ratna-garbhaa and you are a sapphirine boy from a mother, and a sapphire shines only if it is studded in earth-given gold anargham api maaNikyam hemaashrayam apekShate otherwise you, your incarnation, your epic, your mission, why one or two, everything concerning you will be futile, and you have to return to your milky abode empty handed, and here on earth, every house breeds one or more Ravana-s\nRama: How am I to conclude 'this' as 'that...' I mean Goddess Lakshmi\nJanaka: Certain aspects are to be inferred because they are unmanifest. Fire on the mountain is unmanifest but smoke is manifest, hence fire is inferred. So also, ayam iishvarii is manifest as iyam this girl... from siitaa furrow, sillion, a narrow trench in ground made by ploughshare... as a small seed manifests into a gigantic banyan tree, and from this the nature of her non-foetal birth, it is to be inferred likewise, and only because of it she is someone above mortals. Because you have come as a mortal she has to take birth as a mortal, as an inseparable entity of yours\nRama: Then why can't she fall from sky or from other planet?\nJanaka: She cannot. Your connection with this earth is age-old and you love it. Because you love earth, she has to emerge from earth, a lovely act for you.\nRama: Then why mama sutaa... she can be fostered in any orphanage\nJanaka: Not so. An auspicious thing or being requires a sanctum sanctorum... Mithila is one such... and Videha-s are not just kings of this part of land, but they are priests of pious or holy things like the bow of Shiva. You know the naming of vi-deha... it is not 'without bodies...' but transcending bodily affairs Thus she chose this as her background and as she presented herself to me as baby girl, I have look upon her as mama sutaa 'my daughter ' And many, many kings sought her hand in marriage, but I refused and they warred with me, whereby I had to call for the forces of gods to counterattack the enemy forces; perhaps, you might not have heard that humans can summon gods; thus gods are at my disposal; a prayer of mine brings them here, either for a war or for a ritual So, do not take me or my daughter Seetha, iyam siitaa mama sutaa as some ignoramus and insignificant dullards\nRama: Then why you want me to take back, as though she belonged to me for eons, but lost in a journey\nJanaka: Yes, she is yours from ages unknown; I cannot donate her in kanyaa-daana 'bestowal of bride ' because your marriage is eternal. But you two have arrived here in human forms, so conduct yourselves in conformity with human customs.... that is why I tell pratiicCha enaaam ' take her back, wishfully ' for that saying of mine get no anger on me; bhadram te 'let safeness betide' you; by this act of yours paaNim gR^ihNiSva paaNinaa ' you take her palm into your palm ' that which is customary in human paaNigrahaNa-mahotsava 'wedding ceremony '; by the way, you always keep your consort in your heart hR^idaya kamala do not do such things as long as you are on earth for your incarnation will be disclosed.... just take her hand and let not this heavenly discourse be leaked out... lest Ravana may come to know that you are not human and it will be impossible for you to eliminate that evil, thereby\nAnd we now proceed to the human level import of this verse.\nJanaka: 'iyam \"this girl\" who has --- mugdhamanoharamanoj~namohanaatmakasukumaarasoundaryalaavaNyaadau--- a beauty par excellence [and par problmatique beauty as well, for Ravana alone has got more words to extol her beauty, as in Ch. 46 Aranya ];\nso, iyam \"this one\" is about whom you have heard from day one in the hermitage of Siddha, i.e., when you started towards Mithila;\nhence, iyam \"this one alone\" is that girl who is on your psyche from the minute you broke that Shiva's bow, and whom you are envisioning praasaade praade ca pathi pathi ca saa pR^iShTataH saa purataH 'on verandas of multistoried buildings and in window ledges, on this street and that street, before you, behind you ' during these days of your stay in Mithila....\nRama: No, No, No, you are wrong... I did not aim at any girl when aiming to lift that old bow... sorry for your unilateral conclusion...\nJanaka: No, my dear boy, the condition I stipulated before your touching that bow is bilateral... I clearly said that my daughter belongs to one who can lift that bow... you were quick enough to grab the girl, rather than the bow... and in that hastiness you even broke that bow... had you declined the girl, you should have declined to lift the bow, also... so, iyam siita was the only intention of yours when lifting that bow...\nRama; Maybe.. but we want high-born, high-bred girls --- not fatherless, motherless, birth-less orphans\nJanaka: You seem to be a doubting Thomas... that's why I said mama sutaa 'my daughter ' when it is said mahataa tapasaa raama... ' by high degree ascesis Dasharatha obtained Rama.. what does it mean? So also, I too obtained and fostered this girl with much better ascesis [than your father], and even protected her from warring factions [only to give back to you ]; bythe way, the environ of Mithila itself is of utmost sanctity and piety... if we are to be lowly subjects, why your guru Vishvamitra brought you here, that too by foot don't think that you are taking this girl for your personal enjoyment, but it is for a caculated purpose... this girl meets that purpose and her wifehood, as well.... hence I said sahadharmacarii tava ' she will be in toe with your duties'\ntava dharmasahacarii ' whatever is your duty that duty become hers too '..\nRama: Somehow there appears some cacoethes confusion from you, from all the sages, from my father and mothers, even\nJanaka: Nothing of that sort is there... if you wish heartily then only you take her...

            "comment": "Likewise, let us, the readers of rAmAyaNa, keep this info about Rama undisclosed to Ravana, if any of us meet Ravana by chance....\nThe types of ancient marriages as laid down by scriptures are eight kinds. 1] braahmya: inviting a celibate scholar after completion of his Vedic studies, and offering a bride with due ceremony; 2] daiva: offering a bride to a ritwik when he is conducting a Vedic-ritual; 3] aarSa: giving the bride after donating a cow and ox for the success of Vedic-ritual; 4] praajaapatya: offering a bride without seeking anything from the bridegroom, to follow the course of dharma; 5] aasura: giving ample money to bride's party or to bride and marrying her at costs; 6] gaandharva: man and woman falling in love and marrying on their own, just out of lust and bodily pleasures; 7] raakShasa: if a bride or bride's part do not agree, by maltreating, torturing and terrorising them, and thereby seizing the bride; 8] paishaacika: while the girl is asleep, or making her drunk, or unconscious and then molesting her, by which she becomes a 'can't but' bride - a worst kind of marriage.\nAnd when none of the eight is unsuitable for Seetha's wedding it is brought under the fourth praajaapatya- because sahadharmam carati iti praajaapatya - aashvalaayana | samyogamantraH praajaapatye sahadharmam caryataam - gautama | sahadharmam carataam iti praajaapatyam - bodhaayana | But here something is sought from the bridegroom, in the name of lifting the bow.

            "": "undefinedThis Parashu Rama or Bhaargava Rama is believed as the sixth incarnation of Vishnu on earth, prior to Dasharatha Rama. The word parashu 'an axe...' is prefixed to this Rama because he wields a merciless axe. His father was sage Jamadagni and mother Renuka. This Jamadagni is the son of Sage Riciika, a Brahman, and he married Satyavati, the sister of Vishvamitra, a Kshatriya. On certain occasion Jamadagni doubting his wife Renuka's infidelity orders this Parashu Rama to behead her, which he promptly does, but Bhaargava Rama requests his father to bring her back to life. Sage Jamadagni agrees and brings her back to life. This is a kind of entrance test to Parashu Rama, and if he can ruthlessly kill his own mother he does not hesitate to kill any, in future.\nDuring their time, the kings were cruel and homicide was rampant to achieve the desires of the throne, however ruthless it might be. On another occasion when the sons of one Kaartviiryaarjuna sacrifice Sage Jamadagni as a sacrificial human, this Parashu Rama is frenziedly infuriated and starts eliminating all of the enthroned Kshatriya bloodlines on earth. That way he roves over the earth for thirty seven times eliminating Kshatriya-s. He even cuts off the foetuses in wombs of their queens, in order to stop the menacing progeny and offers the blood of the foetus as oblation. And that blood became five streams called shamanta-pancaka. Bhaargava or Parashu Rama practises insurmountable ascesis and appeases God Shiva, and thus acquires divine weaponry. He is indomitable in archery and nothing is unknown to him in the art of archery. Yet, he resorts to an axe to behead cruel kings, physically and personally, without depending up on a distant shooting arrow. He is ciranjiivi 'long living being...' Later when peace is established on earth, this Parashu Rama retires to penance but re-entered here to have a glimpse of Dasharatha Rama. And the purpose and import of his entry at this place, is recorded in later chapters.\nCheck here for rama and and also dasharatha\nThe Fastest SFTP anywhere, Go FTP FREE\n",

Insofar as the incarnations are concerned, it is Vishnu, but not Shiva. In philosophy, both are one and in theology, they are separate. sR^iShTi-sthiti-antakaaraNaat brahma-vishNu-shivaatmikaam | sa sanj~naam yaati bhagavaan eka eva janaardanaH || vishNu-puraaNa api cet samaram praapya bhaviShyasi maam adhikaH | bhaarata - droNa-parva ekam eva advitiiyam brahma - sat eva saumaya idam agram assiit - sarvam khalvidam brahma - brahmaa vaa idam agre asiit - hiraNyagarbhasamavartataagre - antarbahiH ca tat sarvam vyaapya naaraayaNa sthitaH - eka eva rudro na dvitiiyaaya tasthe - ekam sad vipraa bahudhaa vadanti ekam santam bahudhaa kalpayanti - abheda shruti where the last one is 'when there is only one Absolute wise men and poets create many of his forms...' to explain in ordinary parlance, that too through Puraana-s. This is because of the complexity of Vedas. In fact, Vedas do not tell anything straightaway 'this god, that is god...' but asks us, rather intuits us, to infer ourselves about the nature of god, according to our own IQ. And to be precise, Vedic gods are different from Puranic gods and Veda holds on to one Brahman, or The Absolute. The Rain-god, Fire-god, Indra et al are the instrumental gods in knowing that Absolute. The content of Vedas is just like the complexity of complex video game of present day. The more you play you either get yourself addicted to it, or shun it, or get demented by it.\nVedas go on saying pure truths in plain terms like: sham naH suuryorucakShu- udaitu sham nah catasraH pradiipto bhavantu | sham naH dhruvayo bhavantu naH sindhavaH shamu san santi aapaH || R^igveda 7-35-8 - 'Bless that the sun, with extensive radiance, Rises for peace. May the four quarters of horizon, Be auspicious for peace and harmony...' What is so great about the sun or his radiance? If we persist in asking why this is said like that, then a dozen other quotes will be brought in to explain the idea behind it. Again another hymn: sahasrashiirShaa puruShaH sahasraakShaH sahasrapaat | R^igved 10-90-1 - 'He has thousands of heads, He has thousands of eyes...' It would be ridiculous to think of a god with thousands of heads and thousands of eyes, but if it is explained 'He has thousands of heads, to think about mankind, and he has thousands of eyes to watch over the good and bad deeds of mankind... it may be meaningful. Max Muller has this to say about the study of Vedas:\nOf course, this learning of Vedas by heart is carried on under a strict discipline; it is, in fact, considered as a sacred duty. A native friend of mine... tells me that a boy, who is to be brought up as a student of Rig Veda, has to spend about eight years in the house of his teacher. He has to learn ten books: first, the hymns of Rig ved; then a prose treatise on sacrifices, called the braahmaNa; then the so-called Forest book or aranyaka; then the rules of domestic ceremonies; and lastly, six treatises on pronunciation, grammar, etymology, metre, astronomy, and ceremonial...' India can it what teach us, by Max Muller - a recent republication of Penguin.\nAll the above is for no practical utility in these days, except for an enquiry into that 'Brahman.' So also there is a probability for phonetic problem uccaraNadoSa in Vedas which causes pratyavaaya a boomeranging bad effect. If we wish to chant its hymn 'oh, Indra, slay my enemies...' and if a diphthong or a diagraph is mispronounced it becomes 'Oh, Indra, kill me, instead of my enemies...' and it is said to happen that way yad bhaavam tad bhavati... Unless they are practised for a life time, they are un-understandable, hence they are set aside and Puraana-s are brought in their place. Further, the effect of Vedas is said to be declining according to yugadharma era theory... What that was available in satya- yuga a period where the conflict was only between god and man, for e.g., the legend of Harishcandra and his truth speaking, which stands tested by almost all gods, but that truthfulness is lessened in treta-yuga Ramayana's period, where the conflict was between man and demons, which dharma is further lessened in dvaapara-yuga period of Maha Bharata, where the conflict is among one's own brothers, and that much dharma of that period is almost extinct in kali-yuga which is obvious, from the known history of India, where the conflicts are going on between man and man - husband and wife, father and son, neighbour and neighbour, and so on.\nThis is on par with the four-legged dharma, The Holy Bull, nandi loosing its legs one after the other and now you will see that Bull in any sculpture with half raised right foreleg, where other three went under its belly.\nSo Puraana-s are evolved to throw some light on what Vedas have to say, of course with some religious overtones. Elsewhere we have detailed about Puraana-s of them Shiva and Vishnu Puraana-s are though prominent, but their adherers quarrel tooth and nail about the superiority of Shiva or Vishnu. In Vishnu Puraana many instances of coalescence of Vishnu with Shiva are narrated tvat vaakyagauravaat etat mayaa cakram nivartitam | tvayaa yat abhayam dattam tat datttam akhilam mayaa - Krishna says to Shiva at the time of eliminating a demon called Baana Asura, 'As you say I have taken back my disc, and if you give a boon I deem all that is given by me...' So many instances can be quoted like this. But here Parashu Rama has no intention to kill Dasharatha Rama, as said in Padma Puraana: rarakSha bhagavaan - bhaargava raamaH - ekam ikShvaakostu mahaakulam | maataamahasya anvayatvaat reNukaavacanaat tathaa | 'that god Bhaargava Rama safeguarded one great dynasty of Ikshvaku-s, for they are related to his grandmother, besides at the request of Renuka Devi, his mother...' So, god Bhaargava Rama is a nepotist and saved Dasharatha Rama. Not so, Bhaargava Rama is neither a nepotist nor a god to be worshipped. He is not worshipped because his incarnation is not a full incarnation of Vishnu as Dasharatha Rama. Only the wrathful impetuosity of Vishnu is incarnated like Bhaargava Rama to perform butchery and even infanticide. bhaargavo ati dR^iptaH prasiddhaH tadaaniim ca krodhaandha iti svakShatriyavadhaat upratam shastrasannyaasam ca parityajya capala iti viditaH 'Bhaargava Rama is a highly impudent personality and blinded by his wrath, thus to eliminate his own Kshatriya-s [namely his own relatives, Dasharatha and his sons; again the caste system is peeping in, isn't it!] On overstepping his pledge of renunciation of weaponry, he came... hence his actions are faltering...' appayaa diikshita, a shaivaite. He came here to perform certain unsaid action, which we will see in next episode.\n",

A swordsman or an archer needs an arm-length, or sword-length or bow-length, at the least, to swagger his weapon. This place is to be assumed as an isolated place and no one is seeing or listening. This scene has an analogy in Maha Bharata when Krishna teaches Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. There, it is said, that Krishna froze the time to teach all the eighteen chapters, and none among two sides of warring factions are aware of Krishna, his teachings, or of Arjuna, excepting Sanjaya, who is placed at a distant place and has seen all with his wisdom-eye. Here we have to borrow that wisdom-eye of Sanjaya and see at these two Rama-s and their actions. When their episode is over the mist cast around them, rather on our eyes, will be cleared, when Rama returns to his father. This is said in later verses. Further more, all the people available there are rendered unconscious at the arrival of Bhaargava Rama, and a few like Dasharatha, Vashishta, Rama's brothers are with senses. So, even if they hear and see this scene, those listeners or seers do no harm in revealing Rama's godhood to world, or in particular to Ravana.\n"

This apart, his hand has certain ability to extricate the innate nature of others, should he lay his hand on them. We rarely see him touching or patting others, except for Seetha, Lakshmana, Hanuma, and say a squirrel etc. So, it is believed that, Rama has now expropriated the essential nature of Vishnu from Bhaargava Rama, while snatching the bow from his hands.

In the hermitage Vishvamitra it is said that the bow is given in Vedic-ritual taddhi puurvam narashreSTha dattam sadasi daivataiH | 1-31-8 In the previous chapter it is said that the bow is given in the hand of Devaraata devaraatasya raajaRSeH dadau haste sasaayakam | 1-75-20 And earlier it is said to be given in Dasksha's ritual dakSayaj~navadhe puurvam dhanuH aayamya viiryavaan | 1-66-9 Seetha says about this to ascetic Lady Anasuya that Rain-god gave this to Janaka's dynasty mahaayaj~ne tadaa tasya varuNena mahaatmanaa | dattam dhanurvaram priityaa tuuNii caakSayyasaayakau | Ayodhya II-118. These statements, though not self-contradictory, and though they create a little confusion, they all are correct. When Daksha's Vedic-ritual is devastated, Shiva wanted to throw back the useless bow, that was worsted by Vishnu's bow, on the face of gods. But gods fearing for the ire of Shiva requested Shiva to give that bow to Devaraata, on their behalf. Shiva gave it to Devaraata as a trust, through Rain-god Varuna, but Shiva did no bequeath it. Later Janaka on appeasing gods in Vedic-ritual asked them to leave the bow once for all in Janaka Dynasty. Gods have agreed to it. And Rama broke it.\nNow Dasharatha Rama gives back the other bow of Vishnu brought by Parashu Rama to the same Rain-god Varuna, who is present there at both Rama-s, in the thin air, when the environ is enshrouded by certain darkness, and when Rama is last seen with that upraised longbow at 1-76-23, and just before darkness is dissipated, Rama gives that bow to Rain-god, according to the first verse in next chapter.\nWell known is Krishna's showing his Cosmic Form vishvaruupa to Arjuna, while teaching Bhagavad Gita in Maha Bharata. But that Bharata records Rama's display of His Cosmic form to Parashu Rama, only at this juncture. In Ch. 89 of anushaashanika parva of Maha Bharata it is said in detail as: pashya maam svena ruupeNa cakShuH te vitaraamyaham | tato raamashariire vai raama pashyati bhaargavaH |aadityaan pavamaanaan rudraan saadhyaan ca samarudgaNaana | pitaro hutaashanaH caiva nakShatraaNi grahaaH tathaa | and a long account follows on this. But this has not been amplified or explained in other texts, due to unknown reasons. However, it is not part of Valmiki Ramayana.\n",

Here the bride is compelled to tell the name of her husband, and she will be hesitating to do so, because of her newness to this house or to her husband. After some teasing attempts, she mutters her husband's name, and then only she will be admitted into certain chamber or room. But dwindling are these games, and dampening is that fun, in these days of readymade marriages. Then why Dasharatha shall be overjoyed at these womanly functions, they do all those womanish things... because, Dasharatha wanted his palace to be in festivity, with just one son. But four are forced on him and they too obtained four brides in one go, hence fourfold is his happiness.
